what is chimerical and false; it is not a piece of buffoonery so much as a critical exposition. What do we parody but the absurdities
of writers, who frequently make their heroes act against nature, common-sense, and truth? After all, it is the public, not we, who are
the authors of these Parodies.”</p>

<span class="sc">hen</span> this Collection was originally projected it was intended to publish a few only of the best
Parodies of each author. After the issue of the first few numbers, however, the sale rapidly
increased, and subscribers not only expressed their desire that the collection should be made
as nearly complete as possible, but by the loans of scarce books, and copies of Parodies,
helped to make it so.</p>

<p>This involved an alteration in the original arrangement, and as it would have been monotonous to
have filled a whole number with parodies of one short poem, such as those on “To be or not to be,”
“Excelsior,” “My Mother” or Wolfe’s Ode, it became necessary to spread them over several numbers:
In the Index, which has been carefully prepared, references will be found, under the titles of
the original Poems, to all the parodies mentioned. In all cases, where it has been possible to do so,
full titles and descriptions of the works quoted from, have been given; any omission to do this has
been unintentional, and will be at once rectified on the necessary information being supplied.</p>

<p>By the completion of the second Volume of my collection, the works of the following Authors have been
fully treated, William Shakespeare, John Milton, John Dryden, Dr. Watts, Alfred, Lord Tennyson,
H. W. Longfellow, Thomas Hood, Bret Harte, Matthew Arnold, E. A. Poe, Wolfe’s Ode on the Death
of Sir John Moore, and Miss Ann Taylor’s poem “My Mother.” Certainly most of the best parodies
on these Authors have been collected, yet as new ones are constantly appearing, a further collection of
them will appear in a future part of Parodies, which will also contain any good old parodies that may
hitherto have escaped notice.</p>

<p>In a few cases where parodies are to be found in easily accessible works, extracts only have been quoted, or
references given; but it is intended in future, wherever permission can be obtained, to give
the parodies in full, as they are found to be useful for public entertainments, and recitations. When the
older masters of our Literature are reached, a great deal of curious and amusing information will be
given, and it is intended to conclude with a complete bibliographical account of Parody, with extracts
and translations from all the principal works on the topic. Whilst arranging the first and second
volumes, I have been gathering materials for those to come, which will illustrate the works of those
old writers whose names are familiar in our mouths as household words. Much that is quaint and
amusing will thus be collected, whilst many illustrations of our literature, both in prose and verse,
which are valuable to the student, will for the first time be methodically arranged, annotated, and
published in a cheap and accessible form.</p>

<p>In all Collections, such as this, there are some pieces which offend the taste, or run counter to
the prejudice of some individual reader, but great care has been taken to exclude every parody of a
vulgar or slangy description, although it need hardly be said that many such parodies exist.</p>

<p>Every effort has been made to avoid giving preference to the parodies of any Political party, and this
could only be done by inserting the poems on their own merits. If any good Political Parody has been
omitted, ignorance of its existence, not party motive, has been the cause.</p>

<p>I am much indebted to the following gentlemen either for permission to quote from their works, or for
copies of parodies sent to me for publication:--Messrs. P. J. Anderson, of Aberdeen; A. H. Bates,
of Birmingham; W. Butler; George Cotterell (Author of the “Banquet”); T. F. Dillon-Croker; F. B.
Doveton; James Gordon, F.S.A., of Edinburgh; John H. Ingram; Walter Parke (author of “The Lays

of the Saintly”); F. B. Perkins, of the Free Public Library, San Francisco; W. Smith, of Morley, near
Leeds; Basil H. Soulsby, Corpus Christi, Oxford; Joseph Verey; John Whyte; J. W. Gleeson
White; and A. R. Wright. The following ladies have also sent me some amusing parodies:--Miss
E. Orton; Mrs. S. A. Wetmore of New York State; and Mrs. J. E. Whitby. My best thanks are
also due to Mr. Walsh, and his courteous assistants in the Guildhall Library of the City of London, as
well as to the gentlemen in the Library of the British Museum.</p>

<div class="poemtitle"><span class="sc">Dickens in Camp.</span></div>
<div class="i1">Above the pines the moon was slowly drifting,</div>
<div class="i2">The river sang below;</div>
<div class="i1">The dim Sierras, far beyond, uplifting</div>
<div class="i2">Their minarets of snow.</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">The roaring camp-fire, with rude humour, painted</div>
<div class="i2">The ruddy tints of health</div>
<div class="i1">On haggard face and form that drooped and fainted</div>
<div class="i2">In the fierce race for wealth;</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Till one arose, and from his pack’s scant treasure</div>
<div class="i2">A hoarded volume drew,</div>
<div class="i1">And cards were dropped from hands of listless leisure</div>
<div class="i2">To hear the tale anew;</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And then, while round them shadows gathered faster,</div>
<div class="i2">And as the firelight fell,</div>
<div class="i1">He read aloud the book wherein the Master</div>
<div class="i2">Had writ of “Little Nell.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Perhaps ’twas boyish fancy,&mdash;for the reader</div>
<div class="i2">Was youngest of them all,&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">But, as he read, from clustering pine and cedar</div>
<div class="i2">A silence seemed to fall;</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">The fir-trees, gathering closer in the shadows,</div>
<div class="i2">Listened in every spray,</div>
<div class="i1">While the whole camp, with “Nell” on English meadows,</div>
<div class="i2">Wandered and lost their way.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And so in mountain solitudes&mdash;o’ertaken</div>
<div class="i2">As by some spell divine&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Their cares dropped from them like the needles shaken</div>
<div class="i2">From out the gusty pine.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Lost is that camp, and wasted all its fire:</div>
<div class="i2">And he who wrought that spell?&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Ah, towering pine and stately Kentish spire,</div>
<div class="i2">Ye have one tale to tell!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Lost is that camp! but let its fragrant story</div>
<div class="i2">Blend with the breath that thrills</div>
<div class="i1">With hop-vines’ incense all the pensive glory</div>
<div class="i2">That fills the Kentish hills.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And on that grave where English oak and holly</div>
<div class="i2">And laurel wreaths intwine,</div>
<div class="i1">Deem it not all a too presumptuous folly,&mdash;</div>
<div class="i2">This spray of Western pine!</div>

<div class="i1">Among the books the gloom was darkly drifting,</div>
<div class="i2">The writer’s spirits low;</div>
<div class="i1">The duller serials, and the weeklies, lifting</div>
<div class="i2">But melodies of woe.</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">The older authors, with rude humour, painted</div>
<div class="i2">The glowing fun of health</div>
<div class="i1">Now lost in dreary prose, jokes died or fainted</div>
<div class="i2">In sterner race for wealth;</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Till one arose, and from the past’s great treasure</div>
<div class="i2">Of hundred volumes drew,</div>
<div class="i1">A scheme to tap the hoard untold of pleasure</div>
<div class="i2">And bid it flow anew;</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And so the parodies unearthed grew vaster,</div>
<div class="i2">Than ever one could tell,</div>
<div class="i1">All mimicking some mighty poet Master,</div>
<div class="i2">In many a sprightly “Sell.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Perhaps ’tis too fond fancy,&mdash;that the reader</div>
<div class="i2">Should leave the weeklies all,</div>
<div class="i1">Let <cite>Punch</cite> go prosing, scorn the <i>D. T.</i> leader,</div>
<div class="i2">And let <cite>Police News</cite> pall;</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">While ’mid these gambols of poetic shadows,</div>
<div class="i2">Listening to bygone play,</div>
<div class="i1">As each mad parody evokes the glad “Ohs!”</div>
<div class="i2">(As Browning p’raps would say).</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">See Tennyson, in mighty verse&mdash;o’ertaken,</div>
<div class="i2">Mimicked in tripping line&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">When jokes from Longfellow, so grave, are shaken</div>
<div class="i2">Like gush in penny-a-line.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">To find in rush of their poetic fire,</div>
<div class="i2">A comic theme told well,</div>
<div class="i1">While stately verse, and song, and culture higher,</div>
<div class="i2">Are used some joke to tell.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Lost be that scamp, who would no funny story</div>
<div class="i2">Tell in the rhyme that thrills</div>
<div class="i1">Like farthing rushlight posing as the glory</div>
<div class="i2">Of sun o’er ancient hills.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">If, in the crowd of puppets, some poor dolly</div>
<div class="i2">Should ape a bard sublime,</div>
<div class="i1">Deem it not all a too presumptuous folly&mdash;</div>
<div class="i2">To jest is not a crime.</div>

<cite>House of Lords, January</cite>, 1878.</div>
<div class="i1">Which I wish to remark&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">And my language is plain&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">That for ways that are dark,</div>
<div class="i1">And for tricks that are vain,</div>
<div class="i1">The Hebrew Ben D&mdash;&mdash; is peculiar,</div>
<div class="i1">Which the same I would like to explain.</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">I have mentioned his name,</div>
<div class="i1">And I shall not deny,</div>
<div class="i1">In regard to the same</div>
<div class="i1">He is wary and sly;</div>
<div class="i1">And his smile it is mocking and ice-like</div>
<div class="i1">And there isn’t no green in <em>his</em> eye.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Now, some rumours had spread,</div>
<div class="i1">Which Ben D&mdash;&mdash; could not burke,</div>
<div class="i1">And every one said</div>
<div class="i1">He’d been at his old work.</div>
<div class="i1">(It was strange, you must know, how he doated</div>
<div class="i1">Upon the “Unspeakable Turk.”)</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">It was Gran-Vil who rose,</div>
<div class="i1">And quite soft was his style;</div>
<div class="i1">But you must not suppose</div>
<div class="i1">That he hasn’t no guile;</div>
<div class="i1">Yet D&mdash;&mdash; played it that day upon Gran Vil</div>
<div class="i1">In a way that made most of them smile.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Which some questions he’d brought,</div>
<div class="i1">And Ben rose&mdash;as ’twas planned&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">To reply. What was sought</div>
<div class="i1">He did well understand;<a name="Page_2" id="Page_2"></a><span class="pageno">2</span></div>
<div class="i1">But he smiled, as he stood at the table,</div>
<div class="i1">With a smile that was artfully bland.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">How he trifled with sense,</div>
<div class="i1">You would scarcely believe;</div>
<div class="i1">And with cunning intense,</div>
<div class="i1">Fancy statements did weave:</div>
<div class="i1">Whilst he kept back his facts by the dozen,</div>
<div class="i1">And the same, with intent to deceive.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Yes, the tricks that were play’d</div>
<div class="i1">By that Hebrew, Ben D&mdash;&mdash;,</div>
<div class="i1">And the points that he made</div>
<div class="i1">Were quite shocking to me;</div>
<div class="i1">Till at last he sat down amid laughter,</div>
<div class="i1">And chuckling himself, I could see.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Then up sprang Ar-Gyle,</div>
<div class="i1">With his hair flowing free,</div>
<div class="i1">And he gave a wild snort,</div>
<div class="i1">And said, “Shall this be?</div>
<div class="i1">We are humbugged by Asian myst’ries,</div>
<div class="i1">And he went for that Hebrew, Ben D&mdash;&mdash;.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Which the war-dance he had</div>
<div class="i1">Was exciting to watch,</div>
<div class="i1">Though I feared, lest too mad,</div>
<div class="i1">His job he might botch,</div>
<div class="i1">For he whooped, and he raved, and he ranted;&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">You see he’s so pepp’ry and Scotch.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Still, the scene that ensued</div>
<div class="i1">Was uncommonly grand,</div>
<div class="i1">For the floor it was strewed,</div>
<div class="i1">Like the leaves on the strand,</div>
<div class="i1">With the facts that Ben D&mdash;&mdash; had been hiding,</div>
<div class="i1">The facts “He did well understand.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">For his head, which is long,</div>
<div class="i1">Contained facts by the score;</div>
<div class="i1">Which, with effort so strong,</div>
<div class="i1">Ar-Gyle out of it tore;</div>
<div class="i1">Till Ben D&mdash;&mdash;, if he has any feelings,</div>
<div class="i1">Must have, morally, felt very sore.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Which expressions is strong,</div>
<div class="i1">Yet but feebly imply</div>
<div class="i1">What I think of the wrong&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Not to call it a lie&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">As was worked off by Benjy on Gran-Vil,</div>
<div class="i1">Which he can’t go for it to deny.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Which is why I remark&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">And my language is plain&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">That for ways that are dark,</div>
<div class="i1">And tricks that are vain,</div>
<div class="i1">The Hebrew Ben D&mdash;&mdash; is peculiar,</div>

<p>The following parody appeared in <cite>Jon Duan</cite>,
one of Beeton’s Christmas Annuals. The original
poem refers to General Ulysses S. Grant, President
of the United States; the parody is in
allusion to Mr. Albert Grant, M.P., who presented
Leicester Square to the public in July,
1874, and whose name was then prominently
before the public in connection with numerous
financial schemes:<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<p><cite>Scribners’ Monthly</cite> for May, 1881, contained a
humorous collection of imitations of various
authors, entitled “Home, Sweet Home, with
Variations.” It commences by giving a couple
of verses from the original poem by John
Howard Payne; next comes a variation such
as might have been written by Algernon Charles
Swinburne. Walt Whitman, Austin Dobson,
Oliver Goldsmith, and Alexander Pope are also
supposed each to contribute a new setting of
the old song, the imitation of Walt Whitman is

exquisitely humorous; but that which principally
concerns us here is the third imitation,
which is entitled:<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

Ghost</cite>, and described, in twenty-seven verses,
the horrible manner in which a poor lad, named

fagging was in full force in the school, and that
scarcely any supervision was exercised over the

(<i>A Long Way</i>).</div>
<div class="i1">The western sun was sinking fast,</div>
<div class="i1">As through the quiet street there passed</div>
<div class="i1">A tinker with a blackened eye,</div>
<div class="i1">Who ever and anon did cry&mdash;</div>
<div class="i6">“’Brellas to mend.”</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">His brow was dark with smoke and soot,</div>
<div class="i1">His raiment, rags from head to foot;</div>
<div class="i1">And like a penny trumpet rung</div>
<div class="i1">The beery accents of his tongue&mdash;</div>
<div class="i6">“’Brellas to mend.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"></a><span class="pageno">9</span>
<div class="i1">He lingered at the corner “pub,”</div>
<div class="i1">He drew his last coin from his fob;</div>
<div class="i1">He quaffed his glass of half-and-half,</div>
<div class="i1">And only answered to their chaff&mdash;</div>
<div class="i6">“’Brellas to mend.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“Go not again,” the landlord said,</div>
<div class="i1">“Wild blows the tempest overhead,</div>
<div class="i1">Your rags will lash you unto death.”</div>
<div class="i1">Our friend replied with bated breath&mdash;</div>
<div class="i6">“’Brellas to mend.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“Oh, stay,” the daughter said, “and rest</div>
<div class="i1">Thy weary head upon this breast;</div>
<div class="i1">Why should’st thou from our presence fly?”</div>
<div class="i1">This was the tinker’s sad reply&mdash;</div>
<div class="i6">“’Brellas to mend.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“Beware the stern blue-coated man&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Beware the falling chimney-can;”</div>
<div class="i1">Such was the landlord’s parting word,</div>
<div class="i1">And this was the reply they heard&mdash;</div>
<div class="i6">“’Brellas to mend.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">In Duke Street, at the break of day,</div>
<div class="i1">Within a court the tinker lay;</div>
<div class="i1">In falling he his leg had broke,</div>
<div class="i1">When gently raised, these words he <span class="lock">spoke&mdash;</span></div>
<div class="i6">“’Brellas to mend.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">He died; his body calmly rests;</div>
<div class="i1">His ghost the lonely streets infests;</div>
<div class="i1">And often at the midnight hour</div>
<div class="i1">A voice cries, with sepulchral power&mdash;</div>
<div class="i6">“’Brellas to mend.”</div>

<p>The parody of “A Psalm of Life,” entitled
“The Maiden’s Dream of Life,” which was
quoted on page 64, Part <abbr title="four">IV.</abbr>, of <cite>Parodies</cite>, was
copied from a Washington (U.S.) newspaper,
dated December, 1871. The idea of this parody
had evidently been borrowed from one contained
in a small volume by Phœbe Carey,
entitled “Poems and Parodies.” The borrower
made some verbal alterations, which were by no

<p>A long political parody appeared in <cite>Punch</cite>,
February 23, 1867, entitled “The Great Medicine-Man;
a new Canto of Hiawatha.” This
<a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a><span class="pageno">16</span>
was <i>apropos</i> of Mr. Disraeli’s Reform proposals,
then submitted to the House of Commons in
Thirteen Resolutions.</p>

<p>On page 95, Part <abbr title="six">VI.</abbr>, a long extract was
given from a parody of <cite>Hiawatha</cite>, entitled <cite>The
Song of Big Ben</cite>, which appeared in <cite>Truth</cite>,
February 15, 1877. It was descriptive of the
opening of Parliament, and the subsequent proceedings
in the Houses have since been related
in the same metre, and under the same title, in
many other numbers of <cite>Truth</cite>. On page 80
reference was made to a parody which appeared
in <cite>Tom Hood’s Comic Annual for</cite> 1877; unfortunately,
it is much too long to give in full.
The following short extract will, however, give
an idea of its style:<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="center small"><span class="sc">Revenge. A Rhythmic Recollection.</span></p>

<p class="blockquote">If you ask me where I found it, found this very dreadful
legend, with its strange coincidences and its tragic repetitions,
I should answer, I should tell you, in the columns of
the “Pleecenoos,” in the pages of the “Standard,” in the
Organ of the Knife Board, in all sheets of published scandal,
published in the month of August, published in the midst
of Fleet Street, where the tide of life rolls onward, whilst
the modest newsman murmurs low amid the noise of traffic,
“Buy the ‘Hecker,’ fifth edition! Buy the ‘Standard,’
latest war news! Buy the Organ of the Knife Board!”</p>

<p class="blockquote">’Twas the pleasant April weather, and a coach was bound
for Cambridge, and four youths alike in feature sat together
in the rumble; each alike was bound for Cambridge, each
alike in air was noble, each alike in hair was curly, each in
speech was Hebraistic, and they all were bound for Cambridge.</p>

<p class="blockquote">Never had they met before this, though their fathers in
four townships wide apart had heard the rumours of each
other’s great successes in the art of habit-making, famed for
thirteen-shilling trousers; and each parent, little recking of
the others’ great successes, said, “My son shall rise to swelldom;
he shall have his fling at college, and shall dwell
among the nobles who, by my fair art made nobler, wear
my thirteen-shilling trousers.”</p>

<p class="blockquote">As in April’s pleasant weather all the four rolled on to
Cambridge, did they swear eternal friendship; and alighting
from the rumble, pledged each other in great beakers, drank
each other’s healths in “dogsnose;” sought the portals of the
college where they had matriculated, crossed the sunny green
quadrangle, and betook them to their chambers; parted
tearful on the landing, and betook them to their chambers.</p>

 <p class="center">*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*</p>

<p class="blockquote">Then they severed at the doorway; but by devious ways
returning, met again before the doorway.</p>

<p class="blockquote">Then with scowling brows they entered; and the barmaid&mdash;most
impartial of the race of British barmaids&mdash;sweetly
winked in turn upon them till their hearts within them
gladdened; and they drank the luscious “dogsnose,” and
their friendly vows repeated, till with arm-in-arm close
linking they once more the dim quadrangle crossed, and all
was wrapped in silence.</p>

“Excelsior” in <cite>Truth</cite>, fourteen parodies appeared
on November 11, 1880, and the following week
nine more were published, each consisting of five
verses. The parody with the refrain, “That

winner, has already appeared in Part <abbr title="six">VI.</abbr> of
<cite>Parodies</cite>. A few of the others may be given

<p>It will be remembered that the Austrians had
been completely defeated by the Prussians at
Sadowa, on July 3, 1866, and that the Emperor
Francis Joseph had ceded Venetia to Napoleon
<abbr title="Three">III.</abbr>, requesting his intervention with the
King of Prussia to arrange the terms of peace.
From that period until the outbreak of the

<p>In a recent trial for libel brought against the
son of the Lord Chief Justice, the plaintiff had
to conduct his case in person, and was subjected
to continual interruptions, and hostile remarks
from the bench. This conduct on the part of
the judge, Mr. Justice Manisty, was even more
noticeable than his contemptuous treatment of
the verdict of the jury, and the following parody
of a Law Report (which appeared in the <cite>Pall
Mall Gazette</cite>, November 25, 1884)&mdash;is really but
a mild exaggeration of the actual proceedings:<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Trial by Jury in</span> 1884.
<a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a><span class="pageno">20</span></p>

<p class="blockquote">The libel case of &mdash;&mdash; <i>versus</i> &mdash;&mdash; was tried in the Court
of &mdash;&mdash;, before Mr. Justice Manifest. The plaintiff conducted
his own case; the defendant was represented by his
counsel, a great legal luminary, and several of the most
prominent names at the bar. The defendant is the son of a
person high placed in the legal world, and is himself a
barrister. The plaintiff is, vernacularly speaking, “the
deuce knows who.” The alleged libel is contained in a
letter written by the defendant to a widow lady (his great
aunt by marriage), who wished to ally herself by marriage
to the plaintiff.</p>

<p class="blockquote">The plaintiff was proceeding to open his own case, when
the judge asked him why he was not properly represented
by professional counsel, after the manner of a gentleman,
and warned him that such an omission was likely to tell
against him in the gravest manner.</p>

<p class="blockquote">Plaintiff: May it please your lordship, I am a poor man,
and cannot well afford<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="blockquote">Mr. Justice Manifest: The question of your means is
wholly irrelevant. I must request you to keep strictly to
the matter in hand.</p>

<p class="blockquote">Plaintiff: My other reason was that I feared no member
of your respected profession would be quite whole-hearted
in conducting my case, in view of who the defendant is.
(Groans from the members of the Bar present.)</p>

<p class="blockquote">The great legal luminary: I protest against the plaintiff’s
speech as an insult to the entire profession, including your
lordship.</p>

<p class="blockquote">Mr. Justice Manifest condoled warmly with the outraged
feelings of the legal gentlemen present, but urged them to
allow the plaintiff to proceed; as by so doing he would best
reveal to the jury the manner of man he was.</p>

<p class="blockquote">Plaintiff: With the permission of the court, I will first
read the letter.</p>

<p class="blockquote">The great legal luminary objected to this, as unnecessarily
wounding to the feelings of the defendant’s eminent family.</p>

<p class="blockquote">Plaintiff humbly submitted to the court that unless he
were allowed to produce the letter it would be difficult for
the jury to decide whether it were a libel or not. Mr.
Justice Manifest begged the great legal luminary to allow
the letter to be read as a personal favour to himself. The
great legal luminary consenting, the plaintiff read the letter,
which was as follows:&mdash;“My dear Aunt,&mdash;It is with sincere
regret that I see myself forced to point out to you the true
character of the unprincipled scoundrel you are thinking of
marrying. Should you be surprised to hear that he is a
professed atheist? Should you be surprised to hear that he
has been three times married already, and that one of these
marriages took place while the former wife was still alive?
Should you be surprised to hear that many excellent people
suspect him of having made away with his last wife, though
the murder has never been brought home to him? Should
you be surprised to hear that he has on several occasions
embezzled large sums of money? Should you be surprised
to hear that he is a convicted felon? Should you be surprised
to hear that he has a daughter in the workhouse?”…
At this point the reading of the letter was interrupted
by the great legal luminary, who said that the remainder
of it had no bearing on the case.</p>

<p class="blockquote">The plaintiff said he thought he had read enough to give
the court some idea of the animus of the document. He
would next ask if the defendant denied having written it?</p>

<p class="blockquote">The great legal luminary said his client acknowledged
having written the letter.</p>

<p class="blockquote">Mr. Justice Manifest said this was one more instance of
the manly and straightforward manner in which the case
for the defendant was being carried on.</p>

<p class="blockquote">The plaintiff said he had given the defendant an opening
to withdraw his statements in presence of the defendant’s
fa….</p>

<p class="blockquote">Mr. Justice Manifest (interrupting): “I must beg you not
to mention eminent people in no way connected with the
case.”</p>

<p class="blockquote">The plaintiff apologised and continued: The defendant
refused either to withdraw or substantiate his charges.</p>

<p class="blockquote">Mr. Justice Manifest: Quite right too. (Loud cheering.)</p>

<p class="blockquote">The plaintiff next called witnesses to speak to his
character and disprove the charges contained in the letter
which the defendant acknowledged having written, and
refused to withdraw.</p>

<p class="blockquote">The Rev. Lord Bishop of &mdash;&mdash; was sworn, and in answer
to questions said he had known the plaintiff from a boy, and
that he had always borne the highest character.</p>

<p class="blockquote">Several other reverend gentlemen, of whose congregations
the plaintiff had at various times been a prominent member,
were called, and deposed to the same effect&mdash;namely, that
he was a man against whom there had never been a breath
of even ordinary scandal. Also that he was of a most
edifying piety.</p>

<p class="blockquote">Plaintiff: Would it have been possible that such facts as
my having murdered my wife, embezzled money, been a
convicted felon, &amp;c., could have remained unknown to you
during the time I was a member of your congregations?</p>

<p class="blockquote">The Reverend Gentlemen; “Quite impossible.” Plaintiff
then produced evidence that the period during which he had
sat under the various reverend gentlemen extended over his
whole life, from the age of eighteen to the present day.</p>

<p class="blockquote">Mr. Justice Manifest asked the great legal luminary if he
did not wish to cross-examine the witnesses.&mdash;Great legal
luminary: “No, my lord, I have no questions to ask.”</p>

<p class="blockquote">Mr. Justice Manifest thanked him for so considerately
saving the time of the court.</p>

<p class="blockquote">The plaintiff next called witnesses to prove that he had
only been once married, that he had lived in great peace
and harmony with his late wife, that she had died a natural
death, that he had sincerely mourned her, that he had
always supported his daughter honourably, and as well as his
small means would allow.</p>

<p class="blockquote">The great legal luminary scornfully refused to cross-examine
any of the witnesses.</p>

<p class="blockquote">The plaintiff then declared his case closed.</p>

<p class="blockquote">Mr. Justice Manifest: And high time too.</p>

<p class="blockquote">The great legal luminary then opened the case for the
defence: My lord I do not mean to waste the valuable time
of the court, already so mercilessly squandered by the
plaintiff. My client, acting on my advice, has considerately
refused to appear in the witness-box, or to call any witnesses.
I shall not soil myself by attempting to set aside any of the
evidence the plaintiff has thought fit so tediously to inflict
upon the patience of the court. The fact that a man is
obliged to call such evidence to his personal character is, I
should hope, sufficiently significant to all right-thinking and
unprejudiced minds. The law of libel is happily clear and
concise, and is known to all. That the position occupied by
the defendant’s family could in any way influence the
judgment of the court, which, monstrous as it may seem, the
plaintiff has not hesitated to imply, is a supposition I need
not even repudiate. My lord, I have done.</p>

<p class="blockquote">Mr. Justice Manifest: I cannot sufficiently express my
admiration for the moderation with which the counsel for the
defence has expressed himself, or my regret that such a case
should have been brought into court at all. The jury must
now consider carefully whether such a letter, written confidentially
by one member of a family to another, can in any
sense of the word be rightly called a libel, or whether the
whole thing is not a base conspiracy to annoy a family of
high position, and degrade the law. For my own part my
mind is quite made up, and though I have the highest
opinion of juries and their decisions, I must warn the jury
that in the extremely improbable event of their disagreeing
<a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a><span class="pageno">21</span>
with me, I shall reserve to myself the right of setting aside
their decision.</p>

<p class="blockquote">The jury, without retiring, consulted for a few moments,
when the foreman said, My lord, we are unanimously
agreed.</p>

<p class="blockquote">Mr. Justice Manifest: I was sure you would be; and your
verdict is?</p>

<p class="blockquote">The Foreman: We find unhesitatingly for the plaintiff.</p>

<p class="blockquote">Mr. Justice Manifest (with withering sarcasm): Oh, do
you? Then may I ask at what you fix the damages?</p>

<p class="blockquote">The Foreman (after a brief consultation with the other
jurors): At £2,000, my lord.</p>

<p class="blockquote">Mr. Justice Manifest: I have no hesitation in overruling
the decision of the jury, and have much pleasure in deciding
that the court finds for the defendant with costs.</p>

<div class="i1">Lived on a competence easy, Mabel, the <em>belle</em> I have mentioned.</div>
<div class="i1">Fair as to face and so slim; flawless, in sooth, was this damsel;</div>
<div class="i1">Rounded her bust in a manner approved of by painters and sculptors;</div>
<div class="i1">Golden her hair as the sunshine that, careless, got tangled amongst it;</div>
<div class="i1">Blue though her eyes as the ocean, jet black her brows and her lashes;</div>
<div class="i1">Soft was the bloom on her cheeks as the delicate blush upon peaches;</div>
<div class="i1">Seeing her smile, teeth and lips seemed like pearls set in pinkest of coral;</div>
<div class="i1">Snow in her bosom had melted, despairing to rival its whiteness;</div>
<div class="i1">Taper and lithe were her fingers, each with its pink pearl-shell helmet;</div>
<div class="i1">Lightly had Time run the wheels of his chariot over her forehead,</div>
<div class="i1">Never a rut had they made, for the road was like white alabaster,</div>
<div class="i1">All this I saw and still more, though I am not a little short-sighted,</div>
<div class="i1">When at a morning performance by chance I happened to meet her.</div>

<div class="i1">Known to the friend I was with, he in the <i>entr’acte</i> introduced me;</div>

<div class="i1">Little I saw of the play, now even its name I’ve forgotten;</div>
<div class="i1">Little I thought of my friend, but sheltered behind a box curtain,</div>
<div class="i1">Kept I my <i>lorgnette</i> on Mabel, watching her moods and her glances.</div>
<div class="i1">Perfect was each of her poses as that of a painter’s lithe model;</div>
<div class="i1">E’en when she talked to her friends the shape of her lips seemed like poetry;</div>
<div class="i1">Smiles rippled over her face like sunshine upon broken water.</div>

<p>During the war between the Northern and
Southern States of America many humorous
works were published which were intended to
expose the weaknesses, and abuses, in the policy
and administrations of both sides in the struggle.
Amongst these, few were more amusing, or more
popular than the Orpheus C. Kerr (<i>i.e.</i>, office-seeker)
Papers, and the following chapter is
quoted, as it contains imitations of the poets
most popular in the States twenty odd years ago.
Under the thin veil of initials the names may
be traced of H. W. Longfellow, Edward Everett,

<span class="sc">eird</span>, thrilling, and mysterious as
are the poems and novels of this
unfortunate man of genius, nothing
that he ever wrote could call up
the emotions of pity and regret
more powerfully than the melancholy story of
his own wayward career, and his sad and early
death.</p>

<p>Much has recently been written about Poe,
and no difficulty can be found in learning all
that is known, with any certainty, of his singular
career; but an impenetrable veil of mystery still
obscures the record of several years of his life,
in spite of all the research of his numerous
biographers.</p>

<p>The name of Mr. John H. Ingram has long
been associated with these investigations, and
his pen has supplied biographical, and critical
essays, to all the best modern editions of his
works. Many of the following parodies are
copied from the large collection formed by Mr.
Ingram, and especial mention must here be made
of the curious so-called “Spiritual Poems,” supposed
to have been written by the shade of Poe,
which will be referred to later on.</p>

<p>Edgar Allan Poe was born in Boston, United
States, on January 19, 1809. His parents, who
were actors, died leaving him an orphan at an
early age; he was adopted by a wealthy childless
couple, of the name of Allan, by whom he
was brought to England in 1816, and placed in
a school at Stoke Newington. In 1821 he
returned to the United States, and spent some
years in desultory study and romantic rambles
abroad, of which very little, that is reliable, is
known.</p>

<p>At length his friends obtained a nomination
for him to the West Point Military Academy,
to which institution he was admitted as a cadet
on July 1, 1830. But Poe soon took a dislike to
a military career, and wilfully set the authorities
at defiance, so that they had no option but to
expel him. Having thus cast away all chance
of an honourable career in the United States
army, Poe returned to Richmond, to the house
of his only friend and protector, Mr. Allan.
But that gentleman, incensed at his conduct,
would not receive him, and Poe was thus
thrown penniless on the world.</p>

<p>He had already published a few poems, and
now adopted the precarious profession of
journalism, at which he laboured hard for
several years, and then, with no settled income,
still almost unknown, and with few prospects of
an encouraging character, he was rash enough
to marry his cousin, a girl but a little over
fourteen years of age. This was in May, 1836;
after a few years of struggling poverty and
anxiety, his young wife broke a blood-vessel,
and although she lingered on several years, it
was as a doomed invalid, whose death was
almost daily expected.</p>

<p>Poe was much attached to his wife, and
having a highly strung sensitive nature, the
grief and anxiety about her, unfitted him at
times for all mental labour. On such occasions
Poe had recourse to drink, thus adding new
sorrow and fresh misery to his already darkened
home. Yet, during this melancholy period of
his life, Poe produced many of his wonderful
tales of the imagination, and was maturing his
finest poems.</p>

<p>His wife died early in 1846, and Poe, for a
time, led a retired and solitary life; then he
resumed his newspaper work, and his practice
of lecturing on poetry and kindred topics. He
was now fast making his way to a good position,
his fame as a poet was rapidly spreading, his
lecture engagements were remunerative, and it
was rumoured that he was about to marry a
wealthy widow.</p>

<p>With ordinary steadiness and application, a
brilliant future awaited him, but his craving for
drink proved fatal, although he struggled against
it so far as to take the pledge of total abstinence.
He started to visit New York, on business, and
reached Baltimore on October 3, 1849, where it
is supposed that he took some drugged whiskey,
as he was found helpless in the streets. He
was conveyed to the Washington University
Hospital, where he died on the 7th of October,
1849.</p>

<p>Of his Poems, those which are the best known,
and the most generally admired, are amongst the
latest he produced. Thus, “The Raven,” which
obtained a great and immediate success, was
not published until early in 1845; “Eulalie,” in
<a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a><span class="pageno">26</span>
August, 1845; “Ulalume,” most musical, most
melancholy of poems, appropriately appeared
soon after his wife’s death.</p>

<p>“To my Mother” was addressed to his
mother-in-law, and best friend, Mrs. Clemm,
in 1849; “Eldorado” and “For Annie” came
out in the same year; whilst the two very celebrated
poems, “Annabel Lee” and “The Bells”
were not published until after their author’s
death.</p>

<p>All his poems have a melancholy tinge, and,
unlike most modern American authors, Poe
seems almost destitute of humour.</p>

<p>“The Raven” is at once the most characteristic
and the most popular of his poems; it
is also that which is most frequently selected
for parody, or imitation. Many authors have also
adopted the metre for serious poems, such as
“The Gazelle” and “The Dove.” Poe wrote
an ingenious and amusing account of the origin
and growth of “The Raven.” The article is
much too long, and too discursive, to give in
full; but the following extracts contain its most
important passages:<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="center small"><span class="sc">The Philosophy of Composition.</span></p>

<p class="center">*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*</p>

<p class="blockquote">Holding in view these considerations, as well as that
degree of excitement which I deemed not above the popular,
while not below the critical taste, I reached at once what I
conceived the proper <em>length</em> for my intended poem&mdash;a
length of about one hundred lines. It is, in fact, a hundred
and eight.</p>

<p class="blockquote">My next thought concerned the choice of an impression,
or effect, to be conveyed: and here I may as well observe
that, throughout the construction, I kept steadily in view the
design of rendering the work <em>universally</em> appreciable. I
should be carried too far out of my immediate topic were I
to demonstrate a point upon which I have repeatedly insisted,
and which, with the poetical, stands not in the slightest need
of demonstration&mdash;the point, I mean that Beauty is the sole
legitimate province of the Poem.</p>

<p class="blockquote">Regarding, then, Beauty as my province, my next question
referred to the <em>tone</em> of its highest manifestation&mdash;and all
experience has shown that this tone is one of <em>sadness</em>.
Beauty of whatever kind, in its supreme development,
invariably excites the sensitive soul to tears. Melancholy is
thus the most legitimate of all the poetical tones.</p>

<p class="blockquote">These points being settled, I next bethought me of the
<em>nature</em> of my <em>refrain</em>. Since its application was to be
repeatedly varied, it was clear that the <em>refrain</em> itself must
be brief, for there would have been an insurmountable
difficulty in frequent variations of application in any sentence
of length. In proportion to the brevity of the sentence,
would, of course, be the facility of the variation. This led
me at once to a single word as the best <em>refrain</em>.</p>

<p class="blockquote">The question now arose as to the <em>character</em> of the word.
Having made up my mind to a <em>refrain</em>, the division of the
poem into stanzas was, of course, a corollary; the <em>refrain</em>
forming the close to each stanza. That such a close, to
have force, must be sonorous and susceptible of protracted
emphasis, admitted no doubt; and these considerations
inevitably led me to the long <em>o</em> as the most sonorous vowel,

in connection with <em>r</em> as the most producible consonant.</p>

<p class="blockquote">The sound of the <em>refrain</em> being thus determined, it became
necessary to select a word embodying this sound, and at the
same time in the fullest possible keeping with that melancholy
which I had pre-determined as the tone of the poem.
In such a search it would have been absolutely impossible to
overlook the word “Nevermore.” In fact, it was the very
first which presented itself.</p>

<p class="blockquote">The next <em>desideratum</em> was a pretext for the continuous use
of the one word “Nevermore.” In observing the difficulty
which I at once found in inventing a sufficiently plausible
reason for its continuous repetition, I did not fail to perceive
that this difficulty arose solely from the pre-assumption that
the word was to be so continuously or monotonously spoken
by <em>a human</em> being&mdash;I did not fail to perceive, in short, that
the difficulty lay in the reconciliation of this monotony with
the exercise of reason on the part of the creature repeating
the word. Here, then, immediately arose the idea of a
<em>non</em>-reasoning creature capable of speech; and, very
naturally, a parrot, in the first instance, suggested itself,
but was superseded forthwith by a Raven, as equally
capable of speech, and infinitely more in keeping with the
intended <em>tone</em>.</p>

<p class="blockquote">I had now gone so far as the conception of a Raven&mdash;the
bird of ill omen&mdash;monotonously repeating the one word,
“Nevermore,” at the conclusion of each stanza, in a poem
of melancholy tone, and in length about one hundred lines.
Now, never losing sight of the object <em>supremeness</em>, or perfection,
at all points, I asked myself&mdash;“Of all melancholy
topics, what, according to the <em>universal</em> understanding of
mankind, is the <em>most</em> melancholy?” Death&mdash;was the obvious
reply. “And when,” I said, “is this most melancholy of
topics most poetical?” From what I have already explained
at some length, the answer here also is obvious&mdash;“When it
most closely allies itself to <em>Beauty</em>: the death, then, of a
beautiful woman is, unquestionably, the most poetical topic
in the world&mdash;and equally is it beyond doubt that the lips
best suited for such topic are those of a bereaved lover.”</p>

<p class="blockquote">I had now to combine the two ideas, of a lover lamenting
his deceased mistress and a Raven continuously repeating
the word, “Nevermore.” I had to combine these, bearing
in mind my design of varying, at every turn, the <em>application</em>
of the word repeated; but the only intelligible mode of such
combination is that of imagining the Raven employing the
word in answer to the queries of the lover. And here it
was that I saw at once the opportunity afforded for the effect
on which I had been depending&mdash;that is to say, the effect of
the <em>variation of application</em>. I saw that I could make the
first query propounded by the lover&mdash;the first query to which
the Raven should reply “Nevermore” that I could make
this first query a commonplace one&mdash;the second less so&mdash;the
third still less, and so on&mdash;until at length the lover, startled
from his original <em>nonchalance</em> by the melancholy character of
the word itself&mdash;by its frequent repetition&mdash;and by a consideration
of the ominous reputation of the fowl that uttered
it&mdash;is at length excited to superstition, and wildly propounds
queries of a far different character&mdash;queries whose solution he
has passionately at heart&mdash;propounds them half in superstition,
and half in that species of despair which delights in
self-torture&mdash;propounds them not altogether because he
believes in the prophetic or demoniac character of the bird
(which, reason assures him, is merely repeating a lesson
learned by rote) but because he experiences a frenzied
pleasure in so modelling his questions as to receive from the
<em>expected</em> “Nevermore” the most delicious because the most
intolerable of sorrow. Perceiving the opportunity thus
afforded me&mdash;or, more strictly, thus forced upon me in the
progress of the construction I first established in mind the
climax, or concluding query&mdash;that query to which “Nevermore”
<a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"></a><span class="pageno">27</span>
should be in the last place an answer&mdash;that query in
reply to which this word “Nevermore” should involve the
utmost conceivable amount of sorrow and despair.</p>

<p class="blockquote">Here, then, the poem may be said to have its beginning&mdash;at
the end, where all works of art should begin&mdash;for it was
here, at this point of my preconsiderations, that I first put
pen to paper in the composition of the stanza:<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poemtitle"><span class="sc">The Raven.</span></div>
<div class="i1">Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,</div>
<div class="i1">Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,</div>
<div class="i1">As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.</div>
<div class="i1">“’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door,&mdash;</div>
<div class="i6">Only this, and nothing more.”</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Ah, distinctly I remember, it was in the bleak December,</div>
<div class="i1">And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.</div>
<div class="i1">Eagerly I wished the morrow;&mdash;vainly I had sought to borrow</div>
<div class="i1">From my books surcease of sorrow,&mdash;sorrow for the lost Lenore,&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore,&mdash;</div>
<div class="i6">Nameless here for evermore.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain</div>
<div class="i1">Thrilled me&mdash;filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;</div>
<div class="i1">So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating</div>
<div class="i1">“’Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door,&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;</div>
<div class="i6">This it is, and nothing more.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer:</div>
<div class="i1">“Sir,” said I, “or, madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;</div>
<div class="i1">But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,</div>
<div class="i1">And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,</div>
<div class="i1">That I scarce was sure I heard you,”&mdash;here I opened wide the door;</div>
<div class="i6">Darkness there, and nothing more.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there, wondering, fearing,</div>
<div class="i1">Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortals ever dared to dream before;</div>
<div class="i1">But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,</div>
<div class="i1">And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore!”</div>
<div class="i1">This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”</div>
<div class="i6">Merely this, and nothing more.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,</div>
<div class="i1">Soon again I heard a tapping, something louder than before.</div>
<div class="i1">“Surely,” said I, “surely that is something at my window lattice;</div>
<div class="i1">Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore,&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Let my heart be still a moment, and this mystery explore;&mdash;</div>
<div class="i6">’Tis the wind, and nothing more.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,</div>
<div class="i1">In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore.</div>
<div class="i1">Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;</div>
<div class="i1">But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door,&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door,&mdash;</div>
<div class="i6">Perched, and sat, and nothing more.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,</div>
<div class="i1">By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,</div>
<div class="i1">“Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” I said, “art sure no craven,</div>
<div class="i1">Ghastly, grim, and ancient Raven, wandering from the nightly shore.</div>
<div class="i1">Tell me what thy lordly name is on the night’s Plutonian shore!”</div>
<div class="i6">Quoth the Raven, “Nevermore.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,</div>
<div class="i1">Though its answer little meaning, little relevancy bore;</div>
<div class="i1">For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being</div>
<div class="i1">Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door,&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,&mdash;</div>
<div class="i6">With such name as “Nevermore.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">But the Raven, sitting lonely on that placid bust, spoke only</div>
<div class="i1">That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.</div>
<div class="i1">Nothing farther then he uttered; not a feather then he fluttered;</div>
<div class="i1">Till I scarcely more than muttered “Other friends have flown before;</div>
<div class="i1">On the morrow <em>he</em> will leave me, as my hopes have flown before.”</div>
<div class="i6">Then the bird said, “Nevermore.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,</div>
<div class="i1">“Doubtless,” said I, “what it utters is its only stock and store,</div>
<div class="i1">Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster</div>
<div class="i1">Followed fast, and followed faster, till his songs one burden bore,&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Till the dirges of his hope that melancholy burden bore</div>
<div class="i6">Of ‘Never&mdash;nevermore.’”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">But the Raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling,</div>
<div class="i1">Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust, and door;</div>
<div class="i1">Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking</div>
<div class="i1">Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore</div>
<div class="i1">What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore</div>
<div class="i6">Meant in croaking “Nevermore.”</div>
<a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a><span class="pageno">28</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing</div>
<div class="i1">To the fowl, whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom’s core;</div>
<div class="i1">This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining</div>
<div class="i1">On the cushion’s velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o’er,</div>
<div class="i1">But whose velvet violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o’er</div>
<div class="i6"><em>She</em> shall press, ah! nevermore!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer</div>
<div class="i1">Swung by seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.</div>
<div class="i1">“Wretch!” I cried, “thy God hath lent thee&mdash;by these angels he hath sent thee</div>
<div class="i1">Respite&mdash;respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore!</div>
<div class="i1">Quaff, O quaff this kind nepenthe, and forget this lost Lenore!”</div>
<div class="i6">Quoth the Raven, “Nevermore.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!&mdash;prophet still, if bird or devil!</div>
<div class="i1">Whether tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,</div>
<div class="i1">Desolate, yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">On this home by Horror haunted&mdash;tell me truly, I implore,</div>
<div class="i1">Is there&mdash;<em>is</em> there balm in Gilead?&mdash;tell me&mdash;tell me, I implore!”</div>
<div class="i6">Quoth the Raven, “Nevermore.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!&mdash;prophet still, if bird or devil!</div>

<div class="i1">It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore?”</div>
<div class="i6">Quoth the Raven, “Nevermore.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!” I shrieked, upstarting,</div>
<div class="i1">“Get thee back into the tempest and the night’s Plutonian shore!</div>
<div class="i1">Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!</div>
<div class="i1">Leave my loneliness unbroken! quit the bust above my door!</div>
<div class="i1">Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!”</div>
<div class="i6">Quoth the Raven, “Nevermore.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting</div>
<div class="i1">On the pallid bust of Pallas, just above my chamber door;</div>
<div class="i1">And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon’s that is dreaming,</div>
<div class="i1">And the lamp-light o’er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor:</div>
<div class="i1">And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor</div>

<p>At the time when Poe produced “The Raven”
he was editor of “The Broadway Journal,”
published in New York. The first number
appeared on January 4, 1845, and in the number

for April 26, 1845, Poe inserted the following
editorial note, which shows that he was not
averse to a parody of even his own most grave
and solemn poem:<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="i1">While that voice so spell-like bound me&mdash;searching in that tranquil dell,</div>
<div class="i1">Like hushed hymn of holy hermit, heard from his dimly-lighted cell,</div>
<div class="i6">Merely whispering, “Fare thee well!”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Then I stooped once more, and drinking, heard once more the silvery tinkling,</div>
<div class="i1">Of that dim mysterious utterance, like some fairy harp of shell&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Struck by hand of woodland fairy, from her shadowy home and airy,</div>
<div class="i1">In the purple clouds and airy, floating o’er that mystic dell,</div>
<div class="i1">And from my sick soul its music seemed all evil to expel,</div>
<div class="i6">Merely whispering, “Fare thee well!”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Then my book at once down flinging, from my reverie up springing,</div>
<div class="i1">Searched I through the forest, striving my vain terror to dispel,</div>
<div class="i1">All things to my search subjecting, not a bush or tree neglecting,</div>
<div class="i1">When behind a rock projecting, saw I there a white gazelle,</div>
<div class="i1">And that soft and silvery murmur, in my ear so slowly fell,</div>
 <div class="i6">Merely whispering, “Fare thee well!”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">From its eye so mildly beaming, down its cheek a tear was streaming,</div>
<div class="i1">As though in its gentle bosom dwelt some grief it could not quell,</div>
<div class="i1">Still those words articulating, still that sentence ever prating,</div>
<div class="i1">And my bosom agitating as upon my ear it fell,</div>
<div class="i1">That most strange, unearthly murmur, acting as a potent spell,</div>
<div class="i6">Merely uttering, “Fare thee well!”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Then I turned, about departing, when she from her covert starting,</div>
<div class="i1">Stood before me while her bosom seemed with agony to swell,</div>
<div class="i1">And her eye so mildly beaming, to my aching spirit seeming,</div>
<div class="i1">To my wildered spirit seeming, like the eye of Isabel.</div>
<div class="i1">But, oh! that which followed after&mdash;listen while the tale I tell&mdash;</div>
<div class="i6">Of that snow-white, sweet gazelle.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">With her dark eye backward turning, as if some mysterious yearning</div>
<div class="i1">In her soul to me was moving, which she could not thence expel,</div>
<div class="i1">Through the tangled thicket flying, while I followed panting, sighing,</div>
<div class="i1">All my soul within me dying, faintly on my hearing fell,</div>
<div class="i1">Echoing mid the rocks and mountains rising round that fairy dell,</div>
<div class="i6">Fare thee, fare thee, fare thee well!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Now at length she paused and laid her, underneath an ancient cedar,</div>
<div class="i1">When the shadowy shades of silence, from the day departing fell,</div>
<div class="i1">And I saw that she was lying, trembling, fainting, weeping, <em>dying</em>,</div>
<div class="i1">And I could not keep from sighing, nor from my sick soul expel</div>
<div class="i1">The memory that those dark eyes raised&mdash;of my long lost Isabel.</div>
<div class="i6"><em>Why</em>, I could not, <em>could</em> not tell.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Then I heard that silvery singing, still upon my ear ’tis ringing,</div>
<div class="i1">And where once beneath that cedar, knelt my soft-eyed sweet gazelle,</div>
<div class="i1">Saw I there a seraph glowing, with her golden tresses flowing,</div>
<div class="i1">On the perfumed zephyrs blowing, from Eolus’ mystic cell</div>
<div class="i1">Saw I in that seraph’s beauty, semblance of my Isabel,</div>
<div class="i6">Gently whispering, ‘Fare thee well!’”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“Glorious one,” I cried, upspringing, “art thou joyful tidings bringing,</div>
<div class="i1">From the land of shadowy visions, spirit of my Isabel?</div>
<div class="i1">Shall thy coming leave no token? Shall there no sweet word be spoken?</div>
<div class="i1">Shall thy silence be unbroken, in this ever blessed dell?</div>
<div class="i1">Whilst thou nothing, nothing utter, but that fatal, ‘Fare thee well!’”</div>
<div class="i6">Still it answered, ‘Fare thee well!’”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“Speak! oh, speak to me bright being! I am blest thy form in seeing,</div>
<div class="i1">But shall no sweet whisper tell, me,&mdash;tell me that thou lovest still?</div>
<div class="i1">Shall I pass from earth to heaven, without sign or token given,</div>
<div class="i1">With no whispered token given&mdash;that thou still dost love me well?</div>
<div class="i1">Give it, give it now, I pray thee&mdash;here within this blessed dell,</div>
<div class="i6">Still that hated ‘Fare thee well.’”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Not another word expressing, but her lip in silence pressing,</div>
<div class="i1">With the vermeil-tinted finger seeming silence to compel,</div>
<div class="i1">And while yet in anguish gazing, and my weeping eyes upraising,</div>
<div class="i1">To the shadowy, silent seraph, semblance of my Isabel,</div>
<div class="i1">Slow she faded, till there stood there, once again the white gazelle,</div>
<div class="i6"><em>Faintly whispering</em>, “Fare thee well!”</div>

<p>This somewhat dull imitation consists of
twenty-four verses in all, the extracts sufficiently
indicate its style. The numerous parodies to
be found in the American papers as early as
1845 attest how rapidly “The Raven” had
acquired popularity.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The following clever parody appeared originally
in “Cruikshank’s Comic Almanac” for
1853, but it was reproduced in “The Piccadilly
Annual,” published in 1870 by John Camden
Hotten. The parody was written by Robert
Brough, and was most humorously illustrated
by H. G. Hine:<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The Vulture is the most cruel, deadly, and voracious of
birds of prey. He is remarkable for his keen scent, and for
the tenacity with which he invariably clings to the victim on
whom he has fixed his gripe. He is not to be shaken off
whilst the humblest pickings remain. He is usually to be
found in an indifferent state of feather.&mdash;<cite>New Translation of
Cuvier.</cite></p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="i1">Once upon a midnight chilling, as I held my feet unwilling</div>
<div class="i1">O’er a tub of scalding water, at a heat of ninety-four;</div>
<div class="i1">Nervously a toe in dipping, dripping, slipping, then out-skipping,</div>
<div class="i1">Suddenly there came a ripping, whipping, at my chambers door.</div>
<div class="i1">“’Tis the second floor,” I mutter’d, “flipping at my chambers door&mdash;</div>
<div class="i6">Wants a light&mdash;and nothing more!”</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Ah! distinctly I remember, it was in the chill November,</div>
<div class="i1">And each cuticle and member was with influenza sore;</div>
<div class="i1">Falt’ringly I stirr’d the gruel, steaming, creaming o’er the fuel,</div>
<div class="i1">And anon removed the jewel that each frosted nostril bore,</div>
<div class="i1">Wiped away the trembling jewel that each redden’d nostril bore&mdash;</div>
<div class="i6">Nameless here for evermore!</div>

</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And I recollect a certain draught that fann’d the window curtain</div>
<div class="i1">Chill’d me, fill’d me with the horror of two steps across the floor,</div>
<div class="i1">And, besides, I’d got my feet in, and a most refreshing heat in,</div>
<div class="i1">To myself I sat repeating&mdash;“If I answer to the door&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Rise to let the ruffian in who seems to want to burst the door,</div>
<div class="i6">I’ll be &mdash;&mdash;” that and something more.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Presently the row grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,</div>
<div class="i1">“Really, Mister Johnson, blow it!&mdash;your forgiveness I implore,</div>
<div class="i1">Such an observation letting slip, but when a man’s just getting</div>
<div class="i1">Into bed, you come upsetting nerves and posts of chambers door,</div>
<div class="i1">Making such a row, forgetting”&mdash;Spoke a voice beyond the door:</div>
<div class="i6">“’Tisn’t Johnson”&mdash;nothing more!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Quick a perspiration clammy bathed me, and I uttered “Dammy!”</div>
<div class="i1">(Observation wrested from me, like the one I made before)</div>
<div class="i1">Back upon the cushions sinking, hopelessly my eyes, like winking,</div>
<div class="i1">On some stout for private drinking, ranged in rows upon the floor,</div>
<div class="i1">Fix’d&mdash;and on an oyster barrel (full) beside them on the floor,</div>
<div class="i6">Look’d and groan’d, and nothing more.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Open then was flung the portal, and in stepp’d a hated mortal,</div>
<div class="i1">By the moderns call’d a <span class="sc">Vulture</span> (known as <cite>Sponge</cite> in days of yore),</div>
<div class="i1">Well I knew his reputation! cause of all my agitation&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Scarce a nod of salutation changed, he pounced upon the floor;</div>
<div class="i1">Coolly lifted up the oysters and some stout from off the floor,</div>
<div class="i6">Help’d himself, and took some more!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Then this hungry beast untiring fix’d his gaze with fond admiring</div>
<div class="i1">On a piece of cold boil’d beef, I meant to last a week or more,</div>
<div class="i1">Quick he set to work devouring&mdash;plates, in quick succession, scouring&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Stout with every mouthful show’ring&mdash;made me ask, to see it pour,</div>
<div class="i1">If he quite enjoy’d his supper, as I watch’d the liquid pour;</div>
<div class="i6">Said the Vulture “Never more.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Much disgusted at the spacious <em>vacuum</em> by this brute voracious</div>
<div class="i1">Excavated in the beef&mdash;(he’d eaten quite enough for four)&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Still, I felt relief surprising when at length I saw him rising,</div>
<div class="i1">That he meant to go surmising, said I, glancing at the door&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">“Going? well, I won’t detain you&mdash;mind the stairs and shut the door&mdash;&mdash;”</div>
<div class="i6">“Leave you, Tomkins!&mdash;never more.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Startled by an answer dropping hints that he intended stopping</div>
<div class="i1">All his life&mdash;I knew him equal to it if he liked, or more&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Half in dismal earnest, half in joke, with an attempt at laughing,</div>
<a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a><span class="pageno">31</span>
<div class="i1">I remarked that he was chaffing, and demanded of the bore,</div>
<div class="i1">Ask’d what this disgusting, nasty, greedy, vile, intrusive bore</div>
<div class="i6">Meant in croaking “Never more?”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">But the Vulture not replying, took my bunch of keys, and trying</div>
<div class="i1">Sev’ral, found at length the one to fit my private cupboard door;</div>
<div class="i1">Took the gin out, fill’d the kettle; and with a <em>sang froid</em> to nettle</div>
<div class="i1">Any saint, began to settle calmly down the grate before,</div>
<div class="i1">Really as he meant departing at the date I named before,</div>
<div class="i6">Of never, never more!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Then I sat engaged in guessing what this circumstance distressing</div>
<div class="i1">Would be likely to result in, for I knew that long before</div>
<div class="i1">Once (it served me right for drinking) I had told him that if sinking</div>
<div class="i1">In the world, my fortunes linking to his own, he’d find my door</div>
<div class="i1">Always open to receive him, and it struck me now that door</div>
<div class="i6">He would pass, p’raps never more!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Suddenly the air was clouded, all the furniture enshrouded</div>
<div class="i1">With the smoke of vile tobacco&mdash;this was worse than all before;</div>
<div class="i1">“Smith!” I cried (in not offensive tones, it might have been expensive,</div>
<div class="i1">For he knew the art defensive, and could costermongers floor);</div>
<div class="i1">“Recollect it’s after midnight, <em>are</em> you going?&mdash;mind the floor.”</div>
<div class="i6">Quoth the Vulture, “Never more!”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“Smith!” I cried (the gin was going, down his throat in rivers flowing),</div>
<div class="i1">“If you want a bed, you know there’s quite a nice hotel next door,</div>
<div class="i1">Very cheap. I’m ill&mdash;and, joking set apart, your horrid smoking</div>
<div class="i1">Irritates my cough to choking. Having mentioned it before,</div>
<div class="i1">Really, you should not compel one&mdash;<em>Will</em> you mizzle&mdash;as before?”</div>
<div class="i6">Quoth the Vulture, “Never more!”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“Smith!” I cried, “that joke repeating merits little better treating</div>
<div class="i1">For you than a condemnation as a nuisance and a bore.</div>
<div class="i1">Drop it, pray, it isn’t funny; I’ve to mix some rum and honey&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">If you want a little money, take some and be off next door;</div>
<div class="i1">Run a bill up for me if you like, but <em>do</em> be off next door.”</div>
<div class="i6">Quoth the Vulture, “Never more!”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“Smith!” I shriek’d&mdash;the accent humbler dropping, as another tumbler</div>
<div class="i1">I beheld him mix, “be off! you drive me mad&mdash;it’s striking four.</div>
<div class="i1">Leave the house and something in it; if you go on at the gin, it</div>
<div class="i1">Wont hold out another minute. Leave the house and shut the door&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1"><em>Take your beak from out my gin, and take your body through the door!</em>”</div>
<div class="i6">Quoth the Vulture, “Never more!”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And the Vulture never flitting&mdash;still is sitting, still is sitting,</div>
<div class="i1">Gulping down my stout by gallons, and my oysters by the score;</div>
<div class="i1">And the beast, with no more breeding than a heathen savage feeding,</div>
<div class="i1">The new carpet’s tints unheeding, throws his shells upon the floor.</div>
<div class="i1">And his smoke from out my curtains, and his stains from out my floor,</div>
<div class="i6">Shall be sifted never more!</div>

<div class="i1">As I sat thus wond’ring, thinking, fancy unto fancy linking,</div>

<div class="i1">Once, as through the streets I wandered, and o’er many a fancy pondered,</div>
<div class="i1">Many a fancy quaint and curious, which had filled my mind of yore,&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Suddenly my footsteps stumbled, and against a man I tumbled,</div>
<div class="i1">Who, beneath a sailor’s jacket, something large and heavy bore.</div>
<div class="i1">“Beg your pardon, sir!” I muttered, as I rose up, hurt and sore;</div>
<div class="i6">But the sailor only swore.</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Vexed at this, my soul grew stronger: hesitating then no longer,</div>
<div class="i1">“Sir,” said I, “now really, truly, your forgiveness I implore!</div>
<div class="i1">But, in fact, my sense was napping&mdash;&mdash;” then the sailor answered, rapping</div>
<div class="i1">Out his dreadful oaths and awful imprecations by the score,&mdash;</div>
<div class="i6">Answered he, “Come, hold your jaw!</div>

<div class="i1">Straight he showed the heavy parcel, which beneath his arm he bore,&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Showed a cage which held a parrot, such as Crusoe had of yore,</div>
<div class="i6">Which at once drew corks and swore.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Much I marvelled at this parrot, green as grass and red as carrot,</div>
<div class="i1">Which, with fluency and ease, was uttering sentences a score;</div>
<div class="i1">And it pleased me so immensely, and I liked it so intensely,</div>
<div class="i1">That I bid for it at once; and when I showed of gold my store,</div>
<div class="i1">Instantly the sailor sold it; mine it was, and his no more;</div>
<div class="i6">Mine it was for evermore.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Prouder was I of this bargain, e’en than patriotic Dargan,</div>
<div class="i1">When his Sovereign, Queen Victoria, crossed the threshold of his door;&mdash;</div>

<div class="i1">Had I known the dreadful misery which for me Fate had in store,&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Known the fearful, awful misery which for me Fate had in store,</div>

</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Scarcely to my friends I’d shown it, when (my mother’s dreadful groan!&mdash;it</div>
<div class="i1">Haunts me even now!) the parrot from his perch began to pour</div>
<div class="i1">Forth the most tremendous speeches, such as Mr. Ainsworth teaches&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Us were uttered by highway men and rapparees of yore!&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">By the wicked, furious, tearing, riding rapparees of yore;</div>
<div class="i6">But which now are heard no more.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Cat-Fiend.</span><br />
(<i>An Original Adaptation.</i>)</p>

<p>On a bleak evening of December I sat alone in my gloomy
chambers and brooded over the past. I had sought in vain
to turn the current of my thoughts by plunging into metaphysical
researches: <cite>Watts on the Mind</cite> lay open, but
<a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a><span class="pageno">33</span>
unheeded, beside me. Never had the apartment worn so
ghostly an aspect. My lamp threw a fitful gleam upon the
sumptuous but sombre furniture; the fire was expiring, yet I
lacked energy to put on more coals. If I had been expiring
myself I should have hated the man who put coals upon me.</p>

<p>The chief object of my memories was a young person to
whom I had formerly been attached. I dwelt fondly, but
bitterly, upon the day when my <span class="sc">Leonora</span>, accompanied by
her vulgar and intrusive mother, had brightened my dingy
rooms in &mdash;&mdash;’s Inn with her presence to tea, previous to
visiting Drury Lane Theatre. That was all over now;
<span class="sc">Leonora</span> married into the city and left me desolate. I am
not even acquainted with her present name; but it fills me
with despondency to think that her graceful form will never
again press the velvet lining of my quaintly carved arm-chair.</p>

<p>While I sat buried in my sad reflections, it seemed as
though there came a soft rapping at my outer door. It was
growing so late that I made my mind up to disregard the
summons. “It is only <span class="sc">Briggs</span>,” I murmured; “if I admit
him he will weary me with platitudes until the dawn. Or it
is <span class="sc">Potter</span>, perchance, advanced in liquor, I will none
of him.”</p>

<p>At this point the rapping was renewed more loudly. My
resolution suddenly changed, and I resolved that I would
explore the mystery. Making my way to the door I flung it
wide open. The landing was in darkness; no voice gave
answer to my challenge, and, feeling a little nervous, I
slammed the door and went back to my arm-chair by the
fire.</p>

<p>Weird&mdash;ghastly&mdash;inscrutable&mdash;was the apparition that
awaited me! Stretched upon the hearth-rug at my feet
lay a large cat of ebon blackness, glaring at me with a pair
of wild eyes in which anger was mingled with an expression
of diabolical sarcasm. The blood curdled in my veins; I
seized the poker and yelled, “Get out, beast! How dare
you come in here? Go away directly, or&mdash;&mdash;!”</p>

<p>The lips of the animal opened and pronounced slowly and
solemnly the words “<em>Never no more!</em>”</p>

<p>My hair stood on end, and the poker fell from my grasp.</p>

<p>“Horrible being!” I cried;&mdash;“fearful and ungrammatical
being leave me, and return to darkness and the Stygian
shore.”</p>

<p>“<em>Never no more!</em>” said the brute: “I’ve come to stay
for ever.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense, monster; you are insane,” I shouted.</p>

<p>“Fact, I assure you,” replied my tormentor;&mdash;“they
hadn’t got no raven handy, and so they sent <em>me</em>. It’s about
the <span class="sc">Leonora</span> business.”</p>

<p>“Ah, that name! Tell me, I implore you, tell me&mdash;is she
a widow yet? May I hope? Shall I again behold her?”</p>

<p>“<em>Never no more!</em>”</p>

<p>This was too much. I ran and threw the door open again&mdash;came
back&mdash;firmly grasped the poker, and&mdash;<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>But the beast had sought refuge under the sofa. Thence
it retreated beneath my table, and thence under the arm-chair.
Round and round the apartment I chased it vainly.
Its demoniac laugh thrilled me with rage and horror.</p>

<p class="center">*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*</p>

<p>The cat-fiend still inhabits my gloomy chambers. I have
abandoned all hope of expelling it. The creature exists
without food, so that the expedient of starvation is impracticable.
At all hours of the day and night I am haunted by
the wild eyes of my hated persecutor: at all hours of the
day and night I hear the detested brute murmuring with a
chuckle that maddens me,</p>

<div class="i1">Once upon a midnight lately, might be seen a figure stately,</div>
<div class="i1">In the Tuileries sedately poring over Roman lore;</div>
<div class="i1">Annotating, scheming, mapping, Cæsar’s old positions sapping,</div>
<div class="i1">When there came a something rapping, spirit-rapping at the door.</div>
<div class="i1">“’Tis some minister,” he muttered, “come, as usual, me to bore.”</div>
<div class="i6">So to Cæsar turned once more.</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Back to Caesar’s life returning, with a soul for ever yearning,</div>
<div class="i1">Towards the steps his promise-spurning prototype had trod before.</div>
<div class="i1">But the silence was soon broken; through the stillness came a token</div>
<div class="i1">Life had moved again, or spoken on the other side the door.</div>
<div class="i1">“Surely I’ve no trusty servant,” said he, “to deny my door</div>
<div class="i6">Now De Morny is no more.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Rising, of some trespass certain, slow he draws the purple curtain,</div>
<div class="i1">On whose folds the bees uncertain look like wasps, and nothing more:</div>
<div class="i1">Open flings the chamber portal, with a chill which stamps him mortal.</div>
<div class="i1">Can his senses be the sport all of his eyes! For there before</div>
<div class="i1">He sees an eagle perching on a bust of Janus at the door:</div>
<div class="i6">A bleeding bird, and nothing more.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Deep into the darkness peering, not in fear, but only fearing</div>
<div class="i1">Adrien’s vulgar indiscretions, Marx<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_2" id="fnanchor_2"></a><a href="#footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></span> of eaves-dropping in store:</div>
<div class="i1">“Though thy wings are torn and bleeding,” said he, with a voice of pleading:</div>
<div class="i1">“Thou’rt a bird of royal breeding: thou hast flown from foreign shore.”</div>
<div class="i6">Quoth the Eagle, “Matamore.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Started with the stillness broken, by reply so aptly spoken,</div>
<div class="i1">“Silence,” said he, “never utter memories of that field of gore,</div>
<div class="i1">Where your poor Imperial master, whom imperious disaster</div>
<div class="i1">Followed fast, was tortured faster, till his heart one burden bore:</div>
<div class="i1">Till the dirges of his hope, this melancholy burden bore&mdash;</div>
<div class="i6">Never see Carlotta more.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Then upon the velvet sinking, he betook himself to thinking</div>
<div class="i1">How he’d forced the murdered Prince to leave his quiet home of yore;</div>
<div class="i1">How he’d made him wield a sceptre, which no erudite preceptor</div>
<div class="i1">Might have told would soon be wept or lost on that forbidding shore,</div>
<div class="i1">Where earth cries for retribution, where for justice stones implore.</div>
<div class="i6">Quoth the Eagle, “Matamore.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“Wretch!” he cried, “some fiend hath sent thee, by that mocking voice he lent thee</div>
<div class="i1"><a name="edit33" id="edit33"></a>Conscience-driven accusations rising up at every pore&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Must my master-mind so vaunted, ever hence be spectre haunted&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Must I see that form undaunted, dying still at Matamore?”</div>
<div class="i6">Quoth the Eagle, “Evermore.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a><span class="pageno">34</span>
<div class="i1">“Prophet!” shrieked he, “thing of evil! Here we fear nor God nor Devil!</div>
<div class="i1">Wing thee to the House of Hapsburg! Up to Austria’s heaven soar,</div>
<div class="i1">Leave no bloody plume as token, of the lies my soul has spoken,</div>
<div class="i1">Leave my iron will unbroken! Wipe the blood before my door!</div>

<div class="i1">Once upon a morning dismal, as I smoked in blues abysmal,</div>
<div class="i1">Gazing at the curious patterns on the dressing gown I wore,</div>
<div class="i1">While my cat her milk was lapping, suddenly there came a tapping,</div>
<div class="i1">Like a fellow’s knuckles rapping, rapping at my chamber door;</div>
<div class="i1">“It’s that nuisance Smith,” I muttered, rapping at my chamber door&mdash;</div>
<div class="i6">He may rap his fingers sore.”</div>
<div class="poemdivider"><abbr title="two">II.</abbr></div>
<div class="i1">Ah! I do remember clearly small was then my income yearly,</div>
<div class="i1">And to pay my lodging nearly did my slight finances floor;</div>
<div class="i1">And my prospects, never sunny, fishy were as any tunny,</div>
<div class="i1">And I sadly wanted money, money to pay Baize and Blore,</div>
<div class="i1">Pay the fashionable tailors called in Oxford Baize and Blore,</div>
<div class="i6">Who will dun me evermore.</div>
<div class="poemdivider"><abbr title="three">III.</abbr></div>
<div class="i1">But my cat, prophetic pussy, now got ominously fussy,</div>

<div class="i1">So that now to stay her terror and convince her of her error,</div>
<div class="i1">“Tabby,” said I, “it is Smith entreating entrance at my door;</div>
<div class="i1">It’s that feeble Smith demanding entrance at my chamber door,</div>
<div class="i6">Only Smith and nothing more!”</div>
<div class="poemdivider"><abbr title="four">IV.</abbr></div>
<div class="i1">Presently my chair removing, and most seriously reproving</div>
<div class="i1">My grimalkin, for the dreadful way in which she spat and swore,</div>
<div class="i1">From my writing-table’s kneehole stole I softly to the weehole</div>
<div class="i1">Which the people call the keyhole&mdash;keyhole of my chamber door,</div>
<div class="i1">Peeping through it saw another eye the other side the door,</div>
<div class="i6">Looking at me&mdash;nothing more.</div>
<div class="poemdivider"><abbr title="five">V.</abbr></div>
<div class="i1">Straight to stop that sly eye’s prying, to the key my lips applying,</div>
<div class="i1">Blew I such a puff of smoke as no man ever puffed before;</div>
<div class="i1">Then I heard him backward starting, rub his eye as if ’twere smarting,</div>
<div class="i1">And he seemed to be departing, so I whispered, “Is it sore?”</div>
<div class="i1">This I whispered through the keyhole; echo answered “It is sore.”</div>
<div class="i6">Answered thus, and nothing more.</div>
<div class="poemdivider"><abbr title="six">VI.</abbr></div>
<div class="i1">Back I went and felt elated, and my blues had now abated,</div>
<div class="i1">When again I heard that rapping rather louder than before;</div>
<div class="i1">“Surely,” said I, rising, “surely, if he thinks I’ll sit demurely</div>
<div class="i1">While he makes that din securely, his mistake he shall deplore;</div>
<div class="i1">If I only catch him at it, his misdeed he shall deplore&mdash;</div>
<div class="i6">He shall not annoy me more.”</div>
<div class="poemdivider"><abbr title="seven">VII.</abbr></div>
<div class="i1">Open here I flung the portal, when there entered in a mortal,</div>
<div class="i1">Crooked legged, with clothes too short all&mdash;seedy garments that he wore;</div>
<div class="i1">Never once “good morning” bade me&mdash;not a bow or scrape he made me,</div>
<div class="i1">But upon my table laid me down a bill from Baize and Blore,</div>
<div class="i1">Took his stand upon the oilcloth just within my chamber door,</div>
<div class="i6">Stood and hiccupped&mdash;nothing more.</div>
<div class="poemdivider"><abbr title="eight">VIII.</abbr></div>
<div class="i1">Then this festive creature winning all my sad soul into grinning,</div>
<div class="i1">Such a visage idiotic I had never seen of yore;</div>
<div class="i1">“Well, you have been drinking brandy,” said I, “and your legs are bandy,</div>
<div class="i1">And you hardly look a dandy, though you come from Baize and Blore;</div>
<div class="i1">Tell me what on earth your name is in the firm of Baize and Blore?”</div>
<div class="i6">Quoth the tailor, “Tick-no-more!”</div>
<div class="poemdivider"><abbr title="nine">IX.</abbr></div>
<div class="i1">Scarce I wondered this unsightly dun had answered unpolitely,</div>
<div class="i1">And his answer little comfort, little consolation bore;</div>
<div class="i1">For you cannot help confessing that it’s surely not a blessing</div>
<div class="i1">When you find yourself addressing dun within your chamber door;</div>
<div class="i1">Man or dun upon the oilcloth just within your chamber-door,</div>
<div class="i6">With a name like Tick-no-more!</div>
<div class="poemdivider"><abbr title="ten">X.</abbr></div>
<div class="i1">But the tailor standing solus gave me like a bitter bolus</div>
<div class="i1">That one word, as if his vacant soul in that he did outpour;</div>
<div class="i1">Me with no fine words he buttered, this from time to time he stuttered,</div>
<div class="i1">Till I very softly muttered, “other duns have been before;</div>
<div class="i1">They will give me further credit as my tradesmen have before;”</div>
<div class="i6">Then the dun said, “Tick-no-more!”</div>
<div class="poemdivider"><abbr title="eleven">XI.</abbr></div>
<div class="i1">Startled that he spoke so flatly and replied so very patly,</div>
<div class="i1">“Limited,” I said, “it seems is his linguistic stock and store;</div>
<div class="i1">If of no more words he’s master, if he duns not harder, faster,</div>
<div class="i1">Verily he’ll bring disaster on the house of Baize and Blore,</div>
<div class="i1">And I shall remain indebted to the firm of Baize and Blore</div>

<a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a><span class="pageno">35</span>
<div class="poemdivider"><abbr title="twelve">XII.</abbr></div>
<div class="i1">Still his strange demeanour winning all my sad soul into grinning,</div>
<div class="i1">Straight I wheeled a cushioned couch in front of oilcloth, dun, and door;</div>
<div class="i1">Then upon the cushions sinking I betook myself to drinking</div>
<div class="i1">Little sips of sherry, thinking what this plague from Baize and Blore,</div>
<div class="i1">What this gloomy, greasy, groggy messenger from Baize and Blore</div>
<div class="i6">Meant by stuttering “Tick-no-more.”</div>
<div class="poemdivider"><abbr title="thirteen">XIII.</abbr></div>
<div class="i1">But my cat I soothed by stroking, and small bits of bread kept soaking</div>
<div class="i1">In the milk, and gave them to her, dropped them for her on the floor:</div>
<div class="i1">Long I sat, strange things divining, with my head at ease reclining</div>
<div class="i1">Near the sherry I was wining that the dun’s eye gloated o’er;</div>
<div class="i1">But the liquor I was wining with his green eyes gloating o’er</div>
<div class="i6">He shall taste, oh! nevermore.</div>
<div class="poemdivider"><abbr title="fourteen">XIV.</abbr></div>
<div class="i1">Cloud by cloud the air grew denser, perfumed from my meerschaum censer,</div>
<div class="i1">I should think I must have smoked of pipes that morning half a score;</div>
<div class="i1">“Man,” I said, “I have no treasure, or I’d pay the bill with pleasure,</div>
<div class="i1">Only once more take my measure for a suit from Baize and Blore,</div>
<div class="i1">Take your tape and take my measure for a suit from Baize and Blore.”</div>
<div class="i6">Quoth the tailor, “Tick-no-more!”</div>
<div class="poemdivider"><abbr title="fifteen">XV.</abbr></div>
<div class="i1">“Dun!” I cried, “inhuman creature, human still in form and feature,</div>
<div class="i1">Much I’ve hoped you’d take my orders as you’ve always done before;</div>
<div class="i1">Tell me&mdash;for although you’re fuddled, you’re not utterly bemuddled&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Tell me if this hope I’ve cuddled is well-founded, I implore;</div>
<div class="i1">Will they, will they give me credit? tell me clearly, I implore?”</div>
<div class="i6">Quoth the tailor, “Tick-no-more!”</div>
<div class="poemdivider"><abbr title="sixteen">XVI.</abbr></div>
<div class="i1">“Dun!” I cried, “inhuman creature, human still in form and feature,</div>
<div class="i1">By the piper who performed for Moses in the days of yore,</div>
<div class="i1">Tell me won’t, oh! brainless brute, your firm supply to me in future</div>
<div class="i1">Raiment of unequalled suture&mdash;genuine make of Baize and Blore,</div>
<div class="i1">Clothes of rare and radiant suture&mdash;splendid make of Baize and Blore?”</div>
<div class="i6">Quoth the tailor, “Tick-no-more!”</div>
<div class="poemdivider"><abbr title="seventeen">XVII.</abbr></div>
<div class="i1">“Then be off, you sour curmudgeon!” cried I, starting up in dudgeon,</div>
<div class="i1">“Get you back to goose and scissors, get you back to Baize and Blore;</div>
<div class="i1">Leave no long account suggestive of reflections most unfestive,</div>
<div class="i1">Such as make me sleepless, restive&mdash;quit my chamber, quit my door;</div>
<div class="i1">Take your bill from off my table, take yourself from out my door!”</div>
<div class="i6">Quoth the tailor, “Tick-no-more!”</div>
<div class="poemdivider"><abbr title="eighteen">XVIII.</abbr></div>
<div class="i1">Thus the tailor dunned for payment for the raiment, for the raiment</div>
<div class="i1">Mentioned in the bill he did not take from out my chamber door;</div>
<div class="i1">Thus he left me grimly staring, and that long account up tearing,</div>
<div class="i1">Part went up the chimney flaring, part lay scattered on the floor;</div>
<div class="i1">But that bill whose shreds went flying, or lay scattered on the floor</div>
<div class="i6">Now is settled ever more.</div>

<div class="i1">One morning after sleeping I thought I heard a creeping,</div>

<div class="i1">Then a loud impatient tapping put an end unto my napping,</div>

<div class="i1">And by want of proper care hit my leg against a chair,</div>
<div class="i1">Which improperly stood there, as ’twas left the night before,</div>
<div class="i1">And I limped a very little as I crept towards the door&mdash;</div>
<div class="i6">Just a little, nothing more.</div>

<div class="i1">Then on asking, “What’s the matter?” said the servant, “Here’s your water,”</div>

<div class="i1">In my trousers and my vest; then I opened up the door,</div>
<div class="i1">And I muttered as I took it and shut to my bedroom door&mdash;</div>
<div class="i6">“Oh, that shavin’, what a bore!”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">While inwardly I cursed&mdash;thus my feelings I disbursed&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">I set about to rummage and to busily explore;</div>
<div class="i1">But I couldn’t find the strop, and someone had nailed the soap,</div>
<div class="i1">Which completely put a stop to my shavin’&mdash;horrid bore!</div>
<div class="i1">And my razor, too, was blunter than it ever was before&mdash;</div>
<div class="i6">Than it ever was before!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">As I rushed about half raving, I bethought me of this shaving,</div>
<div class="i1">And I wondered that I hadn’t stopped the practice long before:</div>
<div class="i1">So I made an inward vow, that from this moment now,</div>
<div class="i1">My beard should, like my pow, grow at pleasure evermore,</div>

<div class="i1">Though it might have been in August, or it might have been before&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Dreadfully I fear’d the morrow. Vainly had I sought to borrow;</div>
<div class="i1">For (I own it to my sorrow) I was miserably poor,</div>

</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">I was doubtful and uncertain, at the rising of the curtain,</div>

<div class="i1">For a band of robbers drinking in a gloomy cave, and clinking</div>
<div class="i1">With their glasses on the table, I had witness’d o’er and o’er;</div>

<div class="i1">For I know that plays are often brought us from the Gallic shore:</div>
<div class="i6">Adaptations&mdash;nothing more!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">So I put the question lowly: and my neighbour answer’d slowly.</div>
<div class="i1">“It’s a British drama, wholly, written quite in days of yore.</div>

<div class="i1">And the music is delicious, though the dialogue be poor!”</div>

<div class="i1">To my neighbour, “Glance a minute at your play-bill, I implore.</div>
<div class="i1">Who’s that rare and radiant maiden? Tell, oh, tell me! I implore.”</div>
<div class="i6">Quoth my neighbour, “Nelly Moore!”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Then I ask’d in quite a tremble&mdash;it was useless to dissemble&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">“Miss, or Madam, do not trifle with my feelings any more;</div>
<div class="i1">Tell me who, then, was the maiden, that appear’d so sorrow laden</div>
<div class="i1">In the room of David Garrick, with a bust above the door?”</div>
<div class="i1">(With a bust of Julius Cæsar up above the study door.)</div>

<div class="tb">*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*</div>
<div class="i1">I’ve her photograph from Lacy’s; that delicious little face is</div>
<div class="i1">Smiling on me as I’m sitting (in a draught from yonder door),</div>
<div class="i1">And often in the nightfalls, when a precious little light falls</div>
<div class="i1">From the wretched tallow candles on my gloomy second-floor,</div>

<i>A Sentimental Parody.</i></div>
<div class="poemdivider"><abbr title="one">I.</abbr></div>
<div class="i1">Once upon a storm-night dreary, sat I pond’ring, restless, weary,</div>
<div class="i1">Over many a text of Scripture, helped by ancient-sages’ lore,</div>
<div class="i1">Anxious, nervous, far from napping; suddenly there came a tapping!</div>
<div class="i1">As of some one gently rapping&mdash;rapping at my chamber-door.</div>
<div class="i1">Night like this ’tis scarce a visitor, tapping at my chamber-door?</div>
<div class="i6">This, I thought, and nothing more.</div>
<div class="poemdivider"><abbr title="two">II.</abbr></div>
<div class="i1">Ah! distinctly I remember, it was in the bleak December,</div>
<div class="i1">And each separate dying ember, glimmer’d ghostly on the floor:</div>
<div class="i1">Earnestly I wished the morrow; vainly had I sought to borrow</div>
<div class="i1">From my Bible ease of sorrow&mdash;sorrow for the lost Annore&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">For a saintly, radiant matron, whom the angels name Annore</div>
<div class="i6">Lately wife, now wife no more.</div>
<div class="poemdivider"><abbr title="three">III.</abbr></div>
<div class="i1">She had passed the gloomy portals, which forever hide from mortals</div>
<div class="i1">Spirit myst’ries, which the living are most eager to explore.</div>
<div class="i1">Poring o’er the sacred pages, guides to all the good for ages,</div>
<div class="i1">Sat I, helped by lore of sages, when the rapping at my door,</div>
<div class="i1">Startled me as if a spirit had come to my chamber-door,</div>
<div class="i6">Tapping thus, and meaning more.</div>
<div class="poemdivider"><abbr title="four">IV.</abbr></div>
<div class="i1">And the plaintive, low, uncertain rustling of each window-curtain</div>
<div class="i1">Thrill’d me&mdash;filled my quaking heart with terrors never felt before.</div>
<div class="i1"><em>Is</em> there, then, a life of glory, as we’re taught in sacred story?</div>
<div class="i1">Can this be some prophet hoary, standing at my chamber-door&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Prophet from the dead arisen, standing at my chamber-door&mdash;</div>
<div class="i6">Rapping thus, and meaning more?</div>
<div class="poemdivider"><abbr title="five">V.</abbr></div>
<div class="i1">Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,</div>
<div class="i1">“Truly, friend, I treat you badly, your forgiveness I implore;</div>
<div class="i1">Surely I have not been napping, but so gently you came rapping,</div>
<div class="i1">And so faintly you came tapping&mdash;tapping at my chamber-door,</div>
<div class="i1">That I scarce knew what the sound meant”&mdash;here I opened wide the door:</div>
<div class="i6">Darkness there, and nothing more.</div>
<div class="poemdivider"><abbr title="six">VI.</abbr></div>
<div class="i1">Deep into the darkness peering, long I stood there, wondering, fearing,</div>
<div class="i1">Awe-struck, thinking thoughts few mortals ever happ’d to think before;</div>
<div class="i1">But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,</div>
<div class="i1">And the only word there spoken, was the whisper’d word, “Annore!”</div>
<div class="i1">This <em>I</em> whisper’d, and an echo murmur’d back the word “Annore!”</div>
<div class="i6">Merely this, and nothing more.</div>
<div class="poemdivider"><abbr title="seven">VII.</abbr></div>
<div class="i1">Back into my chamber hasting, anguish deeper still now tasting,</div>
<div class="i1">Soon again I heard a rapping&mdash;something louder than before.</div>
<div class="i1">Surely, thought I, that is something at my window-lattice;</div>
<div class="i1">Let me see, then, what there at is, and this mystery explore;&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Oh! my heart, be still a moment, till this mystery I explore;&mdash;</div>
<div class="i6">Is’t the wind, and nothing more?</div>
<div class="poemdivider"><abbr title="eight">VIII.</abbr></div>
<div class="i1">Open here I flung the shutter, when with gentle nod and flutter,</div>
<div class="i1">In there came a gracious white dove of the saintly days of yore.</div>
<div class="i1">Then, as if obeisance made he, and no longer stopp’d or stay’d he,</div>
<div class="i1">But in innocence array’d, he perch’d above my chamber-door,&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Perch’d upon a bust of Paulus, just above my chamber-door&mdash;</div>
<div class="i6">Perch’d and sat, and nothing more.</div>
<div class="poemdivider"><abbr title="nine">IX.</abbr></div>
<div class="i1">Then this snowy bird surprising my sad heart into surmising,</div>
<div class="i1">Whether this was done at random, or some mystic meaning bore,&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">“Surely,” said I, “thou art fairer than of ill to be the bearer,</div>
<div class="i1">Of such saintly guise the wearer, thou art from some heav’nly shore;</div>
<div class="i1">Wilt thou help me on my journey toward that bright celestial shore?”</div>
<div class="i6">Quoth the white dove, “Evermore!”</div>
<div class="poemdivider"><abbr title="ten">X.</abbr></div>
<div class="i1">Startled now as one from dreaming, suddenly awak’d and seeming</div>
<div class="i1">To have heard a voice mysterious thrilling to his heart’s deep core,&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Ev’ry thought and feeling reaching after light and further teaching.</div>
<div class="i1">In attitude of one beseeching, gazed I at my chamber-door,&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">At the bird, which had so aptly&mdash;perch’d upon my chamber-door&mdash;</div>
<div class="i6">Spoken out that “Evermore!”</div>
<div class="poemdivider"><abbr title="eleven">XI.</abbr></div>
<div class="i1">But the white dove’s aspect childly, and his soft eyes beaming mildly,</div>
<div class="i1">Loving looks, as if a full heart speedily he would outpour,</div>
<div class="i1">Led me to expect revealing, unto which my soul appealing,&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">With a strange hope o’er me stealing, such as never came before,&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">“May I look for peace and comfort such as I’ve ne’er felt before?”</div>
<div class="i6">And the bird said, “Evermore!”</div>
<div class="poemdivider"><abbr title="twelve">XII.</abbr></div>
<div class="i1">So the bright bird thus beguiling all my sad soul into smiling,</div>
<div class="i1">Straight I wheel’d a cushion’d chair in front of bird and bust and door;</div>
<div class="i1">Then upon the soft seat sinking, I betook myself to linking</div>
<a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"></a><span class="pageno">38</span>
<div class="i1">Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this holy bird of yore&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">What this lovely, sweet, angelic, quaint, prophetic bird of yore&mdash;</div>
<div class="i6">Meant by saying, “Evermore?”</div>
<div class="poemdivider"><abbr title="thirteen">XIII.</abbr></div>
<div class="i1">Thus I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing,</div>
<div class="i1">Till the calm light from those mild eyes seem’d to illume my bosom’s core;</div>
<div class="i1">Banishing all fear and sadness, bringing thither peace and gladness,</div>
<div class="i1">Driving out surmise of madness&mdash;lately coming o’er and o’er&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Madness casting dreadful shadow,&mdash;lately coming o’er and o’er&mdash;</div>
<div class="i6">Shadow deep’ning evermore!</div>
<div class="poemdivider"><abbr title="fourteen">XIV.</abbr></div>
<div class="i1">Then methought the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer,</div>
<div class="i1">Swung by seraphim, whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.</div>
<div class="i1">“Oh, my soul, thy God hath heard thee, by these angels and this bird He</div>
<div class="i1">Hath to sweetest hopes now stirr’d thee&mdash;hopes of finding thy Annore</div>
<div class="i1">In the far-off land of spirits&mdash;of reunion with Annore!”</div>
<div class="i6">Quoth the dove, “For evermore!”</div>
<div class="poemdivider"><abbr title="fifteen">XV.</abbr></div>
<div class="i1">“Prophet,” said I, “thing of glory! prophet, as in ancient story,</div>
<div class="i1">Whether sent from heaven directly, or by chance cast here ashore,</div>
<div class="i1">Blessings many on thee rest now! yea, thou surely shalt be blest now!</div>
<div class="i1">Come into my open’d breast now&mdash;tell me truly, I implore,</div>
<div class="i1"><em>Is</em> there a heaven of rest and rapture? tell me, tell me, I implore!”</div>
<div class="i6">Quoth the white bird, “Evermore!”</div>
<div class="poemdivider"><abbr title="sixteen">XVI.</abbr></div>
<div class="i1">“Prophet,” said I, “thing of glory! prophet, as in ancient story,</div>
<div class="i1">By that Heav’n which bends above us&mdash;by the God the good adore,</div>
<div class="i1">Tell this soul with hope upspringing&mdash;faith undying to it bringing&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">If that radiant matron singing midst the angels, named Annore,</div>
<div class="i1">Shall be mine again to love&mdash;the sainted matron, named Annore?”</div>
<div class="i6">And the dove said, “Evermore!”</div>
<div class="poemdivider"><abbr title="seventeen">XVII.</abbr></div>
<div class="i1">“Be that word thy sign of dwelling in my heart, of to it telling</div>
<div class="i1">Messages of love and mercy from the far-off shining shore;</div>
<div class="i1">Let thy white plumes be a token of the truth thy soul hath spoken;</div>
<div class="i1">Keep my faith and hope unbroken; always perch above my door;</div>
<div class="i1">Keep thy eyes’ light in my heart; and keep thy form above my door;”</div>
<div class="i6">Quoth the sweet bird, “Evermore!”</div>
<div class="poemdivider"><abbr title="eighteen">XVIII.</abbr></div>
<div class="i1">And the white dove, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting</div>
<div class="i1">On the polish’d bust of Paulus, just above my chamber-door;</div>
<div class="i1">And his eyes with kindness beaming&mdash;holy spirit’s kindness seeming,&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">And a soft light from him streaming, sheds its radiance on the floor;</div>
<div class="i1">And my glad soul in that radiance, that lies floating on the floor,</div>

<div class="i1">“Cat,” said I, “or kitten, kindly stop that rolling on the floor.”</div>
<div class="i1">But it was most irritating, for the sound was unabating,</div>
<div class="i1">On my nerves for ever grating was the rolling on the floor;</div>
<div class="i1">Till at last I cried in anguish, “Stop that rolling I implore;”</div>
<div class="i6">And a voice said, “Nevermore.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">This convinced me of my error, up I rose in greatest terror,</div>
<div class="i1">Certain that ’twas not a kitten that had spoken just before;</div>
<div class="i1">Then into the darkness peering, shivering, wondering, doubting, fearing,</div>
<div class="i1">I could dimly see a pudding rolling on my chamber floor;</div>
<div class="i1">I could see a big plum pudding rolling on my chamber floor;</div>
<div class="i6">May I see it nevermore!</div>

<div class="i1">From its mouth a vapour steaming, while its fiery eyes were gleaming,</div>
<div class="i1">Gleaming fiercely bright, and seeming fixedly to scan me o’er;</div>
<div class="i1">Soon it rolled and rumbled nearer, and its aim becoming clearer,</div>
<div class="i1">I could see that it intended jumping higher than the floor;</div>
<div class="i1">Yes, it jumped upon my chest, and when in pain I gave a roar,</div>
<div class="i6">All it said was, “Nevermore.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Though my back was nearly broken, this reply so strangely spoken,</div>
<div class="i1">Seemed to me to be a token that it wished for something more;</div>
<div class="i1">So my thoughts in words expressing, I began my sins confessing,</div>
<div class="i1">Saying I had eaten pudding many a time in days of yore,</div>
<div class="i1">But although I’d eaten pudding many a time in days of yore,</div>
<div class="i6">I would eat it nevermore.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Still in spite of my confessing, that plum pudding kept on pressing,</div>
<div class="i1">Pressing with its weight tremendous ever on my bosom’s core,</div>
<div class="i1">Till I cried, “O, monster mighty, in my work I’m often flighty,</div>
<div class="i1">But, if you will now forgive me, I’ll work hard at classic lore!”</div>
<div class="i1">At the end of this vacation I’ll work hard at classic lore,</div>
<div class="i6">Quoth the pudding “Nevermore.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“Be that word our sign of parting, pudding!” then I shrieked, upstarting,</div>
<div class="i1">“Get thee back&mdash;get off my stomach, roll again upon the floor!”</div>
<div class="i1">Thus I struggled, loudly screaming, till I found I had been dreaming,</div>
<div class="i1">Dreaming like a famous poet once had dreamt in days of yore;</div>
<div class="i1">But although ’twas like the poet’s dream he dreamt in days of yore,</div>
<div class="i6">May I dream it nevermore!</div>

<p>The major of a Georgian regiment, writing to the United
States Treasurer, said, “I send to you for redemption a
fragment of a five dollar bill, the rest of which was destroyed
under strangely curious circumstances. I dropped it into my
pocket in company with some loose tobacco, and, after
supper, taking a quid, I chewed money and tobacco, leaving
scraps of the bill and fragments of tobacco in my pocket.
When I discovered the <em>sad catastrophe</em> I went for the masticated
quid, but all traces of the money had vanished, and,
‘like the baseless fabric of a dream, left not a wreck behind.’”</p>

<div class="i1">Memories of the past steal o’er me, and remind me of a story,</div>
<div class="i2">That in all its doleful sadness I have never told before.</div>
<div class="i1">Well, I loved a girl named Mary, whose old daddy owned a dairy,</div>
<div class="i2">And a bull-dog, large and powerful, who a frightful visage wore,</div>
<div class="i2">And one night I went to court her as I’d often done before,</div>
<div class="i6">But I’ll court her nevermore.</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Quite distinctly I remember, ’twas one warm night in September,</div>
<div class="i2">That I sat and held my Mary&mdash;held her till my arms were sore,</div>
<div class="i1">And upon her lips I kissed her till I almost raised a blister.</div>
<div class="i2">Since that night, oh, how I’ve missed her&mdash;missed the girl whom I adore;</div>
<div class="i2">Oh, ye gods of Mount Olympus, lend your pity, I implore,</div>
<div class="i6">I shall kiss her nevermore.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“Seems to me the air grows hotter. How I love this old man’s daughter!”</div>
<div class="i2">Were my musings as I held her&mdash;held the girl whom I adore.</div>
<div class="i1">While my Mary Ann was napping, suddenly I heard a rapping</div>
<div class="i2">Like a footfall softly tapping on the old man’s bedroom floor,</div>
<div class="i2">And I muttered, as I listened through the slightly opened door,</div>
<div class="i6">“I have heard that step before.”</div>
<a name="Part_15" id="Part_15"></a>

</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">I shook Mary Ann to wake her, and I said “May Old Nick take her!”</div>
<div class="i2">(But I’m sure I didn’t mean it), then she woke with one loud snore.</div>
<div class="i1">While she sat up widely gaping, barely wakened from her napping,</div>
<div class="i2">I informed her of the tapping I have spoken of before;</div>
<div class="i2">Then she laughed and said, “’twas nothing but the mice upon the floor,</div>
<div class="i6">Little mice and nothing more.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Then once more like some huge boulder fell her head upon my shoulder,</div>
<div class="i2">And I held her very tightly as she snored snore after snore;</div>
<div class="i1">Soon again I heard the falling of more footsteps, and the calling</div>
<div class="i2">Of her daddy, and I wished I was in Spain or Ecuador.</div>
<div class="i2">“Mary Ann!” the old man uttered, as he strode across the floor,</div>
<div class="i6">“Mary Ann,” and nothing more.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Suddenly, as if like magic, with a face that looked quite tragic,</div>
<div class="i2">Mary woke and saw her daddy standing in the parlour door,</div>
<div class="i1">Then with eyeballs wildly gleaming, and her hair about her streaming,</div>
<div class="i2">From the room the girl ran screaming as the clock was striking four,</div>
<div class="i2">Ran more swiftly, screamed more loudly than she ever had before,</div>
<div class="i6">Ran and screamed, and nothing more.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">At the barn the cock was crowing, and I thought I would be going,</div>
<div class="i2">So I started very quickly to retreat across the floor,</div>
<div class="i1">But the old man quick did foller, then he took me by the collar,</div>
<div class="i2">And you oughter heard me holler as he pitched me through the door.</div>
<div class="i2">“Seek ’em, Bull!” he loudly uttered, in a sort of fiendish roar.</div>
<div class="i6">Merely that, and nothing more.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Quickly to my feet I scrambled, and across the yard I ambled.</div>
<div class="i2">As I heard that bull-dog coming, bent on tasting human gore.</div>
<div class="i1">Soon he seized me by the breeches, and I gave some awful screeches,</div>
<div class="i2">As the entire seat in fragments from my Sunday pants he tore.</div>
<div class="i2">With my right hand lifted skyward, “I will kill that dog!” I swore.</div>
<div class="i6">This I said, and nothing more.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Soon the dog his grip releases, and from chasing me he ceases</div>
<div class="i2">While he stopped to chew the pieces that he from my breeches tore.</div>
<div class="i1">Once across my shoulder glancing, with the moonlight o’er him dancing,</div>
<div class="i2">I espied the old man prancing like a madman in the door,</div>
<div class="i2">And I muttered, “Men like you should be slaughtered by the score,</div>
<div class="i6">And you’ll raise the count one more.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">While the broadcloth Bull was chewing, I my way was still pursuing,</div>
<div class="i2">And I soon, quite tired and panting, lay upon my cottage floor.</div>
<div class="i1">Then I cursed my Mary’s daddy, and I called him an old paddy,</div>
<div class="i2">And I swore I’d whip the laddy till my pardon he’d implore.</div>
<div class="i2">But she’s lost to me for ever, the dear girl whom I adore,</div>
<div class="i6">Ay, for ever&mdash;evermore.</div>

<div class="i1">On the ocean swiftly sailing, with the western daylight failing,</div>
<div class="i1">And a fair south-wester with us, scudding o’er the waters blue,</div>
<div class="i1">O’er the bulwarks I was leaning, and my eyes my hand was screening;</div>
<div class="i1">For I wish’d to learn the meaning of a strange sail now in view,</div>
<div class="i1">Of a vessel in the offing, coming slowly into view.</div>

<div class="i1">And our ladder was made ready by two seamen strong and steady,</div>

<div class="i1">Surely, thought I, I am dreaming, to see visitor like that,</div>
<div class="i1">See a captain come to see us in a way so strange as that!</div>
<div class="i6">What on earth can he be at?</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Then the cabin did we enter, and before we could prevent her,</div>

<div class="i6">With green eyes and ebon hair.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Still upon the captain’s shoulder, strange it seemed to the beholder,</div>
<div class="i1">In the twilight of the cabin, among strangers standing so;</div>
<div class="i1">And I fancied it would fright her when the cuddy lamps grew lighter.</div>
<div class="i1">And I mused upon the writer of “The Raven,” Edgar Poe,</div>
<div class="i1">On that weird and wondrous genius, wilful, wayward Edgar Poe,</div>
<div class="i6">Dead now eighteen years ago!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">There she stood, with green eyes gleaming; there she stood, with tail outstreaming,</div>
<div class="i1">A black line athwart the cuddy, rising somewhat high in air.</div>
<div class="i1">And the captain look’d behind him, as though puss in spell did bind him,</div>
<div class="i1">And, without a sound, inclined him to keep looking o’er his chair,</div>
<div class="i1">To keep turning to the black cat, on his shoulder o’er the chair,</div>

<div class="i1">Once in a dress-circle, weary with discussing many a query</div>
<div class="i1">Of the palmy days of acting, and of quaint dramatic lore&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,</div>
<div class="i1">As of some one gently rapping, rapping at a chamber-door.</div>
<div class="i1">“’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “outside the dress-circle door,</div>
<div class="i6">Wants a seat, and nothing more.”</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Then the flapping&mdash;sad, uncertain, rustling of the painted curtain&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Thrilled me, filled me with fantastic visions never felt before</div>
<div class="i1">Of the coming Macbeth’s greeting, wondering if his repeating</div>
<div class="i1">Would delight me; while the visitor kept tapping at the door,</div>
<div class="i1">And I said “Where is the box-keeper, to open yonder door?</div>
<div class="i6">For the tapping is a bore.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And myself the door unlocking, just to end the tiresome knocking,</div>
<div class="i1">In there stepped a solemn Croaker of the palmy days of yore;</div>
<div class="i1">Not the least obeisance made he, not a minute stopped or stayed he,</div>
<div class="i1">Passed each fashionable lady with long skirts upon the floor,</div>
<div class="i1">Scanned his voucher through gold-mounted and green spectacles he wore,</div>
<div class="i6">Took his seat, and nothing more.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Then this Croaker grave, beguiling my sad fancy into smiling</div>
<div class="i1">By the grave and stem decorum of the countenance he wore.</div>
<div class="i1">Though his aspect was un<em>nerving</em>, I began to speak of Irving&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">For I’ doubted not that he had seen of Macbeths many a score&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">And I blandly then suggested a Shakespearian treat in store,</div>
<div class="i6">When he answered, “Nevermore.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Much I marvelled this ungainly swell to hear discourse so plainly</div>
<div class="i1">In the midst of Irving advocates, who voted him a bore&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">In an audience all agreeing that no living being</div>
<div class="i1">Ever yet was blest with seeing acting such as that in store,</div>
<div class="i1">Quoting <cite>Hamlet</cite>, <cite>Richelieu</cite>, and <cite>The Bells</cite>, and many pieces more,</div>
<div class="i6">For the laurels Irving wore.</div>
<a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"></a><span class="pageno">43</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">But the Croaker, sitting lonely, in his cushioned chair spoke only</div>
<div class="i1">That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.</div>
<div class="i1">Nothing further then he uttered; I was net a little fluttered,</div>
<div class="i1">And at last I feebly muttered, “Other Macbeths played before&mdash;”</div>
<div class="i1">“Kemble, Kean, Macready, Young,” he cried, “I saw them all of yore&mdash;</div>
<div class="i6">Won’t be equalled any more!”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Startled at the stillness broken, by reply so aptly spoken&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">“Doubtless,” said I, “what he utters is his sole dramatic lore,</div>
<div class="i1">Caught from some Shakespearian master, when unmerciful disaster</div>
<div class="i1">Followed faster still and faster, as the crowd his parts ignore,</div>
<div class="i1">Till the dirges of his hope that melancholy burden bore&mdash;</div>
<div class="i6">“Tragedian, play no more!”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Then methought the air grew denser, perfumed from a Rimmel censer,</div>
<div class="i1">Swung by pretty girls, whose footfall tinkled on the tufted floor.</div>
<div class="i1">“Wretch!” I cried; “pray who-hath sent thee? Hath some rival Macbeth lent thee</div>
<div class="i1">His spare ticket to content thee with fond memories a store,</div>
<div class="i6">Of the Macbeths seen of yore?”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“Croaker,” said I, “pray be civil, and of Irving speak no evil.</div>
<div class="i1">Whether rivalry hath brought thee or stage memories of yore,</div>
<div class="i1">Are you really not enchanted by this new Macbeth undaunted</div>
<div class="i1">In this house by Hamlet haunted? Tell me truly, I implore,</div>
<div class="i1">Is there, <em>is</em> there hope of <cite>Macbeth</cite>? Tell me, tell me, I implore!”</div>
<div class="i6">Quoth the Croaker, “Say no more!”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“Croaker,” said I, “cease to level those stern glances at the revel.</div>
<div class="i1">By the bust of Shakespeare o’er us&mdash;by the bard we both adore&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Tell this soul with sorrow laden, if within thy distant Aidenn</div>
<div class="i1">Ever widow, wife, or maiden Lady Macbeth’s mantle wore</div>
<div class="i1">With a grace beyond Miss Bateman?” Still this croaking man of yore</div>
<div class="i6">Answered grimly, “Yes, a score.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“Be that word our sign of parting, Croaker,” then I said, upstarting;</div>
<div class="i1">For the curtain now is rising, and I hear a deafening roar.</div>
<div class="i1">Not a word hath Macbeth spoken; he can only bow in token</div>
<div class="i1">Of the homage all unbroken. Then the Croaker spoke once more:</div>
<div class="i1">“Truly this Macbeth reminds me of a figure seen before</div>
<div class="i6">Over many a snuff-shop-door.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And the Croaker, never flitting, still was sitting, his brows knitting,</div>
<div class="i1">Growling oft at Irving’s action, voice, and costume that he wore,</div>
<div class="i1">And his eyes had all the seeming of a croaker who was dreaming</div>
<div class="i1">Of Macready, Kemble, Kean, and Young, in palmy days of yore;</div>
<div class="i1">And the last words that he muttered, as he passed the circle-door,</div>
<div class="i6">Were&mdash;“I’m very glad ’tis o’er.”</div>

<p>This amusing parody originally appeared in
<cite>Funny Folks</cite>, March 6, 1875, accompanied by a
portrait of Dr. E. V. Kenealy. This was immediately
after his election as member for Stoke,
and the week after it appeared the clever but
eccentric advocate of the “unfortunate nobleman”
inserted the parody in his newspaper,
<cite>The Englishman</cite>, with a compliment to its author,
and it was re-copied in many other newspapers.
The author, Mr. Joseph Verey, a well-known contributor
to dramatic and humorous periodicals,
has written many other clever parodies, amongst
them being “Mariana at the Railway Station,”
inserted on page 4, Volume <abbr title="one">I.</abbr>; and “The
Night Policeman,” after Longfellow, inserted
on page 68, Volume <abbr title="one">I.</abbr> of this collection.</p>

<div class="poemtitle">“<span class="sc">The Raven.</span>”<br />(<i>After Edgar Allan Poe.</i>)</div>
<div class="i1">Late at midnight I was seated, and my brain was overheated</div>
<div class="i1">With reflections quaint and curious as I thought my subject o’er;</div>
<div class="i1">While I pondered, almost napping, suddenly there came a tapping</div>
<div class="i1">As of someone softly rapping, rapping at the parlour door,</div>
<div class="i1">And my heart it fairly fluttered, hearing at the parlour-door,</div>
<div class="i6">Just a tap, and nothing more.</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Yes! distinctly I remember how I trembled in each member,</div>
<div class="i1">Thought I saw in every ember ghastly forms of one or more;</div>
<div class="i1">Goblins came before my vision, grinning wildly with derision,</div>
<div class="i1">There I sat as though in prison, prison closed by parlour-door,</div>
<div class="i1">Icy chill came creeping o’er me whilst I gazed upon the door,</div>
<div class="i6">Getting frightened more and more.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And the windy gusts uncertain through the window shook the curtain,</div>
<div class="i1">Thrilled me, filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before.</div>
<div class="i1">Then methought perhaps the rapping might be but the servant tapping</div>
<div class="i1">That awoke me from my napping, she might then be at the door,</div>
<div class="i1">Bringing me the nightly candle, candlestick with broken handle,</div>
<div class="i6">As she’d often done before.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Then my soul grew strong in valour, and my cheeks lost all their pallor,</div>
<div class="i1">“Maid,” said I, “or Mary, just you place the candle at the door,</div>
<div class="i1">Pond’ring was I, almost napping, when you came so gently tapping,</div>
<div class="i1">And you came so softly rapping, rapping at the parlour-door;</div>
<div class="i1">Mary, scarcely could I hear you,” then I went unto the door&mdash;</div>
<div class="i6">Darkness there, and nothing more!</div>

</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Scarcely had I got me seated, feeling still all over-heated,</div>
<div class="i1">When again I heard the rapping louder than it was before,</div>
<div class="i1">“Bless me!” said I, “This again, something’s at the window-pane,</div>
<div class="i1">Now some knowledge I’ll obtain of this strange mysterious bore;</div>
<div class="i1">Courage, heart! a single moment, while this mystery I explore.</div>
<div class="i6">’Tis the wind, and nothing more!”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Scarce the words my tongue had spoken, scarce the silence I had broken,</div>
<div class="i1">Thro’ the window stepped a raven like to Ingoldsby’s of yore,</div>
<div class="i1">Notice took he of me never, off he hopped and looked so clever,</div>
<div class="i1">Flight he took with bold endeavour, perching o’er my parlour door,</div>
<div class="i1">From his perch he eyed me closely, watched me from the parlour-door,</div>
<div class="i6">Sat and looked&mdash;did nothing more!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Cunning looked he, as though chaffing&mdash;funny bird! he set me laughing,</div>
<div class="i1">Perched aloft, and looking grave, with both his eyes upon the floor:&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">“Ebony friend, with head all shaven, surely thou canst be no craven,</div>
<div class="i1">Out so late, you funny raven, tell me what misfortune bore</div>
<div class="i1">Thee unto my humble roof, and to sit above my door.”</div>
<div class="i6">Quoth the raven, “Say no more!”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“Tell me, raven, what has brought you, how it is that you’ve bethought you</div>
<div class="i1">Here to fly in midnight darkness, coming hither to explore.</div>
<div class="i1">Hast thou good or evil omen to pronounce to men or <em>wo</em>men,</div>
<div class="i1">Which thou wilt reveal to no men&mdash;speak the message, I implore.”</div>
<div class="i1">Then he ruffled all his feathers, speaking from the parlour-door,</div>
<div class="i6">Said he, “Think the matter o’er.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">There he was with mien so stately, looking solemn and sedately.</div>
<div class="i1">Like a monk he was “complately,” thinking something deeply o’er,</div>
<div class="i1">All at once his wings he fluttered, and in tone sepulchral muttered</div>
<div class="i1">Something indistinctly uttered, as it came from o’er the door;</div>
<div class="i1">Most intently did I listen, listened as I ne’er before</div>
<div class="i6">To a raven o’er a door.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">&mdash;At the Prince’s Pierhead, said he, there you’ll find a policeman steady,</div>
<div class="i1">Strutting proudly ever ready to annoy the cabmen there,</div>

<div class="i1">Vain it is the men appealing, one and all they now declare</div>
<div class="i1">Pierhead rank they’ll never stand in, never ply for landing “fare”</div>
<div class="i6">Whilst that “bobby’s” stationed there!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">At the Town Hall banquet lately, was a Colonel bold and stately,</div>
<div class="i1">Full of pomp he was “complately,” sitting rigid in his chair.</div>
<div class="i1">When the Army’s health was toasted, up he rose and proudly boasted,</div>
<div class="i1">Whilst with with’ring tongue he “roasted” Captain Douglas sitting there,</div>
<div class="i1">That the Naval forces never, whilst he sat upon that chair</div>
<div class="i6">With the Army must compare!</div>
<a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a><span class="pageno">45</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">When the Colonel Yates, conceited, had his fulsome speech completed,</div>
<div class="i1">And upon his chair was seated,&mdash;Colonel Steble, gallant “Maire,”</div>
<div class="i1">Said with gracious tone and manly, how the noble House of Stanley</div>
<div class="i1">Oft in former times like him had sat upon the civic chair;</div>
<div class="i1">Then the noble Earl, replying, said with truth he might declare</div>
<div class="i6">“Such an honour now was rare!”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Chinamen out there in “<em>Pee</em>king,” Treaty obligations breaking,</div>

<div class="i1">Telling them the British nation anger’d cannot brook evasion;</div>

<div class="i1">Thus he spake what he intended, and his croaking speech was ended,</div>
<div class="i1">Flapping wings he soon descended from his perch above the door.</div>
<div class="i1">Not another word was spoken, nor again the silence broken,</div>
<div class="i1">He had given me the token, and he hopp’d along the floor,</div>
<div class="i1">Thro’ the window into darkness&mdash;glancing at my parlour door,</div>

<div class="poemtitle"><span class="sc">A Black Bird that Could Sing but Wouldn’t Sing.</span><br />
(<i>A Lyric of the American Southern States.</i>)</div>
<div class="i1">Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,</div>
<div class="i1">O’er the War of the Rebellion and the things that were before;</div>
<div class="i1">While I sat absorbed in thinking, brandy cocktails slowly drinking,</div>
<div class="i1">Suddenly I saw a blinking, one-eyed figure at my door&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Saw a nasty, stinking, blinking, one-eyed figure at my door,</div>
<div class="i1">Standing up as stiff as steel-yards, just across my chamber floor,</div>
<div class="i6">Peeping in, and&mdash;nothing more.</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Ah! I never shall forget it, how in glancing round I met it,</div>
<div class="i1">And I ever shall regret it that I looked towards that door,</div>
<div class="i1">For I saw a monstrous figure&mdash;like a giant, only bigger,</div>
<div class="i1">And there stood a big buck nigger, with his back against the door,</div>
<div class="i1">Darting, with a hideous snigger, glances right across my floor,</div>
<div class="i1">A reeking, lantern-jaw’d buck nigger bolt upright against my door,</div>
<div class="i6">Glancing in, and&mdash;nothing more.</div>

</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Quick instinctively espying where my ham and eggs were frying,</div>
<div class="i1">There I saw a poker lying near the hearth upon the floor,</div>
<div class="i1">And with most determined vigour seized and hurled it at the nigger,</div>
<div class="i1">But so quick was he on the trigger, as he jump’d it struck the door,</div>
<div class="i1">Struck beneath him, as he bounded just like lightning from the floor,</div>
<div class="i1">As like a tarr’d and feather’d Mercury, up he bounded from the floor,</div>
<div class="i6">Grazed his heel, and&mdash;nothing more.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Back toward my hearth-stone looking, where my ham and eggs were cooking,</div>
<div class="i1">Shaking, quaking as no mortal ever shaked or quaked before,</div>
<div class="i1">Soon I heard the ugly sinner mutter forth these words, “<em>Some dinner</em>,”</div>
<div class="i1">Looking still more gaunt and thinner, even than he looked before,</div>
<div class="i1">These the words the heathen mutter’d&mdash;the sole and only sound then uttered,</div>
<div class="i1">As down from his high jump he flutter’d ’lighting on his major toe,</div>
<div class="i6">“Dinner,” said he, nothing more.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Then his impudence beginning, he displayed his gums in grinning,</div>
<div class="i1">And with eyes aught else but winning, leer’d upon me from the door,</div>
<div class="i1">Speaking thusly: “’Tis your treat, man, I’ll never go into the street, man,</div>
<div class="i1">Till I get some grub to eat, man, I shall <em>never</em> leave your door,</div>
<div class="i1">Never quit them aigs and bacon, now just done, I’m very sure,</div>
<div class="i1">Never till I’ve cleaned the platter, though you beat me till I roar,</div>
<div class="i6">Treat me, or I’ll charge ’em sure.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Then toward the fireplace marching, where my coffee too was parching,</div>
<div class="i1">Boldly stalked this sassy nigger right across my chamber-floor,</div>
<div class="i1">Never stopped to bend or bow, sir, then I knew there’d be a row, sir,</div>
<div class="i1">For I made a solemn vow, sir, he should soon recross that floor,</div>
<div class="i1">And I kicked him through the room, sir, back again toward the door,</div>
<div class="i1">Kick’d and cuffed him, in my anger, back against my chamber-door,</div>
<div class="i6">Then I kicked him yet once more.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">But this midnight bird beguiling my stirr’d spirit into smiling,</div>
<div class="i1">By the wretched, rabid, ravenous look his hungry visage wore,</div>
<div class="i1">“Tho’,” I said, “thou art a freedman, thou hast gone so much to seed, man,</div>
<div class="i1">So I’ll give you one good feed, man, as you seem to be so poor&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">One good feed in your sore need, man, as you seem so very poor;</div>
<div class="i1">The eggs and meat <em>shall</em> be my treat, if with light work you’ll pay the score.”</div>
<div class="i6">Quoth the nigger&mdash;“Work no more.”</div>
<a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a><span class="pageno">46</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Much I marvelled this ungainly nigger should refuse so plainly</div>
<div class="i1">Just to do a little work, for food he craved and needed sore,</div>
<div class="i1">For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being</div>
<div class="i1">Should decline to labour seeing that he was so deuced poor;</div>
<div class="i1">Should refuse to earn a dinner, which he hungered for I’m sure,</div>
<div class="i1">And would have damned his soul by stealing had he hoped to make the door;</div>
<div class="i6">Escaping thence to&mdash;work no more.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Awhile I sat absorbed in musing, what meant he by this refusing,</div>
<div class="i1">Till, mad, I turned into abusing the odious, odorous blackamoor.</div>
<div class="i1">“Sure,” said I, “you must be crazy, to be so infernal lazy,</div>
<div class="i1">So cussedly, outrageous lazy, as to want to work no more;</div>
<div class="i1">You ugly, grim, ungainly, ghastly, heathen, savage blackamoor,</div>
<div class="i1">Will you even work for wages&mdash;food and clothes and payment sure?”</div>
<div class="i6">Quoth the nigger&mdash;“Work no more.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“Nigger,” said I, “horrid demon! <em>Nigger still if slave or freeman</em>,</div>
<div class="i1">Pause and ponder ere you answer this one question, I implore:</div>
<div class="i1">Have you got no sense of feeling? do you mean to live by stealing?</div>
<div class="i1">Or by working and fair dealing; tell me truly, I implore,</div>
<div class="i1">On your honour as a nigger, will you ever labour more?</div>
<div class="i1">Plough in corn or hoe in cotton, as you did in days of yore?”</div>
<div class="i6">Quoth the Nigger&mdash;“Nevermore!”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Startled by the stillness broken by reply so flatly spoken,</div>
<div class="i1">“Doubtless,” said I, “this big nigger once could eat enough for four,</div>
<div class="i1">When on some grand rice plantation, he could out-eat all creation,</div>
<div class="i1">Until his corporal situation warned him he could eat no more;</div>
<div class="i1">Scorning any calculation of how much cash it cost I’m sure,</div>
<div class="i1">For the master paid the piper in the good old days of yore,</div>
<div class="i6">Days he’ll revel in no more!”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“Nigger,” said I, “thing of evil! quit my sight! <em>go to the devil!</em></div>
<div class="i1">Or even yet, pause, reconsider terms I’ll offer you no more,</div>
<div class="i1">Tell me truly, I implore you, for the last time I conjure you,</div>
<div class="i1">If good wages I ensure you, and clothes the best you ever wore,</div>
<div class="i1">Will you work three days in seven, at tasks far lighter than of yore?</div>
<div class="i1">Only three short days in seven&mdash;labour light and payment sure?”</div>
<div class="i6">Quoth the nigger&mdash;“Work no more.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“Be that word our sign of parting, nigger man,” I said upstarting,</div>
<div class="i1">“Get you gone to where you came from, let me see your face no more.</div>
<div class="i1">Quick, vamose, cut dirt&mdash;skedaddle&mdash;seek some far-off, distant shore,</div>
<div class="i1">Haste, relieve me of that visage&mdash;<em>darken</em> not again my door,</div>
<div class="i1">Join the army&mdash;go to Texas! Never come back here to vex us,</div>
<div class="i1">Take your gaze from off my victuals&mdash;take your carcase from my door”&mdash;</div>
<div class="i6">Quoth the nigger&mdash;“Nevermore.”</div>

</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And the nigger, never working, still is shirking&mdash;still is shirking</div>
<div class="i1">Every kind of honest labour, in the house or out of door,</div>
<div class="i1">And his eye has all the seeming of a vulture’s starved and dreaming,</div>
<div class="i1">And my bacon, gently steaming tempts him still to cross my floor.</div>
<div class="i1">But I’ll gamble with that poker that I hurled at him before,</div>
<div class="i1">That I’ll maul his very lights out, if he dares to pass that door,</div>
<div class="i6">He <em>shall</em> work or&mdash;eat no more!</div>

<div class="i1">Once, while in the Cowgate dirty, on an evening damp and murky,</div>
<div class="i1">Mournfully I gazed at objects swarming there from door to door,</div>
<div class="i1">From a whisky palace, swearing, a poor woman issued, bearing</div>
<div class="i1">A child upon her bosom bare, and that bosom stained with gore,</div>
<div class="i1">And she uttered dreadful threats against the man that kept the store&mdash;</div>
<div class="i6">Idle threats, and nothing more.</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">To myself I said, in terror, “Surely here there is some error;</div>
<div class="i1">This woman seems in deep distress&mdash;distress which pierces to the core;”</div>
<div class="i1">So I stepped into the palace, with the view of getting solace,</div>
<div class="i1">For that creature whose deep sorrow my soft heart with anguish tore,</div>
<div class="i1">That shadow of an angel bright, for her countenance yet bore</div>
<div class="i6">Trace of beauty, now no more.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">But the jingling of the glasses, and the glare of many gases,</div>
<div class="i1">Made me feel so very squeamish that I was almost forced to roar,</div>
<div class="i1">When my tongue its wonted action ceased, as if by some attraction,</div>
<div class="i1">So I stood a perfect dummy at this dreadful gin-house door,</div>
<div class="i1">Pointing to that weeping woman, whom no one would now adore;</div>
<div class="i6">This I did, and nothing more.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">To my speech at last succeeding, I asked gravely why the bleeding,</div>
<div class="i1">Helpless, ill-clad, ill-fed woman had been out-cast from the store?</div>
<div class="i1">And the answer from the monster who had been this woman’s wrongster</div>
<div class="i1">Was, she had not filthy lucre to pay off her whisky score;</div>
<div class="i1">He’d be blowed, or something stronger, if he’d give her any more;</div>
<div class="i6">And he thought her quite a bore.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Then I felt my fingers itching, and my muscles all a twitching,</div>
<div class="i1">To seize the rascal by the throat, and stretch him straight upon the floor;</div>
<div class="i1">But he gave a loud hoarse chuckle, let me see his mighty knuckle,</div>
<div class="i1">And advised me for my safety that I’d better seek the door&mdash;</div>

<div class="poemtitle">LINES<br />
<i>Respectfully dedicated to the</i><br />
Right Honourable Henry Bouverie William Brand, M.P.,<br />
Speaker of the House of Commons.</div>
<div class="i1">“Once upon a Wednesday dreary, while I listened somewhat weary,</div>
<div class="i1">To the dull and dismal business going on upon the floor,</div>
<div class="i1">On me, in my melancholy, broke the voice of Mr. Whalley,</div>
<div class="i1">Pouring forth of words a volley, and this, too, I meekly bore;</div>
<div class="i1">‘’Tis near five o’clock,’ I muttered, and my lot I meekly bore,</div>
<div class="i6">Hoping there was little more.</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“For since noon I had been sitting, and the daylight now was flitting,</div>
<div class="i1">As M.P.’s, their places quitting, noiselessly pass’d through the door,</div>
<div class="i1">Motions, though, in such a number did the notice-book encumber,</div>
<div class="i1">That I’d vainly sought to slumber, though my eyes were tired and sore,</div>
<div class="i1">Dared not nap like those around me, though my eyes were red and sore;</div>
<div class="i6">But a watchful look I wore.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“Tired of talking, Whalley finished, and my list was thus diminished</div>
<div class="i1">By the Bill on ‘Open Spaces’&mdash;this it was his name that bore&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Next, I saw with heartfelt pleasure, came an agricultural measure;</div>
<div class="i1">For methought no member surely over this dry Bill will pore&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">They will not discuss its details, they will never o’er it pore;</div>
<div class="i6">Merely pass it&mdash;nothing more.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“So I thought, until up-glancing, I beheld a form advancing</div>
<div class="i1">From the seats below the gangway, boldly out upon the floor,</div>
<div class="i1">‘Stay,’ mused I; ‘I know that figure. Yes, it <span class="lock">is&mdash;it</span> must be Biggar!’</div>
<div class="i1">Through the House there passed a snigger, but my heart was very sore;</div>
<div class="i1">For he caught my eye, confound him! and my heart was very sore;</div>
<div class="i6">Hope was left in it no more.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“Not the least obeisance made he, nor where he had risen stay’d he;</div>
<div class="i1">But he strode across the gangway, nearer to me than before.</div>
<div class="i1">All the time that he was walking, he was hoarsely at me talking,</div>
<div class="i1">Nothing stopping him nor baulking, not a moment he forebore,</div>
<div class="i1">Caring not for sneers nor laughter, not a moment he forebore,&mdash;</div>
<div class="i6">But talked on for evermore.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“Much it grieved me this ungainly man to hear discourse so plainly,</div>
<div class="i1">Though his phrases little meaning, little relevancy bore,</div>
<div class="i1">For I knew his stubborn nature, knew, too, in the Legislature,</div>
<div class="i1">That so obstinate a member it had never known before;</div>
<div class="i1">That a member so pig-headed never had been known before,</div>
<div class="i6">Never would be evermore.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">‘‘Far too “narrer” is this measure,’ quoth he, slowly, at his leisure;</div>
<div class="i1">‘Yes, it’s very much too “narrer!”’ then he went its clauses o’er;</div>
<div class="i1">Turn’d it inside out, and twisted its provisions, as he listed;</div>
<div class="i1">While his friend Parnell assisted&mdash;helped this most portentous bore;</div>
<div class="i1">Backed him up, and often prompted this unmitigated bore;</div>
<div class="i6">Who kept speaking evermore!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“Presently my wrath grew stronger, hesitating then no longer,</div>
<div class="i1">‘Sir!’ I said, ‘you’re not in order; keep in order, I implore!</div>
<div class="i1">This is but the second reading, yet you are in sooth proceeding</div>
<div class="i1">As though in Committee pleading; cease from this or leave the floor!</div>
<div class="i1">Mean you long to go on speaking, mean you long to keep the floor?’</div>
<div class="i6">Quoth J. Biggar, ‘Evermore!’</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“Then methought his voice grew hoarser, and his manner rather coarser;</div>
<div class="i1">Till that he my eye had ever caught, I did at heart deplore;</div>
<div class="i1">Why, I thought, has Cavan sent thee? can no earthly power prevent thee?</div>
<div class="i1">None bring respite and nepenthe, from thy rudeness and thy roar?</div>
<div class="i1">Am I doomed to always listen to thy inharmonious roar?’</div>
<div class="i6">Quoth J. Biggar, ‘Evermore.’</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“‘Biggar,’ said I, ‘Joseph Biggar, why thy most undoubted vigour,</div>
<div class="i1">Didst thou not devote to business on thy own Ulsterian shore?</div>
<div class="i1">Why not give to lard and bacon, all the energies mistaken,</div>
<div class="i1">Thou from night to night art wasting on this House of Commons floor?</div>
<div class="i1">Stick to lard! Drop legislating! This of thee I would implore!’</div>
<div class="i6">Quoth J. Biggar, ‘Nevermore.’</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“‘Biggar,’ said I, ‘tell me truly, wilt thou always be unruly?</div>
<div class="i1">Is there nothing thy lost senses can to thee at last restore?</div>
<div class="i1">Wilt this chamber long be haunted by thy presence so undaunted?</div>
<div class="i1">Or would’st thou at home be wanted if pigs fetched much less per score&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">If lard fell a lot per bladder? Tell me&mdash;tell me, I implore?”</div>
<div class="i6">Quoth J. Biggar, ‘Nevermore!’</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“‘Joseph,’ said I, ‘have a care, sir, lest thou shouldst me too much dare, sir,</div>
<div class="i1">For I give thee warning, fair sir, that if thou art much a bore,</div>
<div class="i1">I will henceforth always try, sir, that thou mayst not catch my eye, sir,</div>
<div class="i1">When in future thou mayst rise, sir, and stand out upon this floor!&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Stand in all thy blatant boldness on this desecrated floor;</div>
<div class="i6">Thou shalt catch it nevermore!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“But J. Biggar never stirring, went on stating and averring,</div>
<div class="i1">Naught him staying or deterring, still his speech did he outpour,</div>
<div class="i1">And back on my cushion sinking, I was filled with dread at thinking</div>
<div class="i1">That this grim and greasy member might for ever harshly roar&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">That this grim, ungainly, lardy man might never cease to bore,&mdash;</div>
<div class="i6">But talk on for evermore!”</div>

<div class="poemtitle"><span class="sc">The Baby.</span></div>
<div class="i1">Once upon a midnight dreary, whilst I waited, faint and weary,</div>
<div class="i1">On the landing till the doctor the expected tidings bore;</div>
<div class="i1">Whilst I nodded, nearly napping, dreaming of what then was happing&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Dreaming of what then was happing t’other side yon chamber door,</div>
<div class="i1">Stood the doctor there, and whispered, opening the chamber door,</div>
<div class="i6">“’Tis a boy!” and nothing more.</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Ah, distinctly I remember, by my chilblains, ’twas December,</div>
<div class="i1">And I stamped each smarting member, stamped it smartly on the floor.</div>
<div class="i1">Eagerly I wished for slumber, as my feet and hands grew number;</div>
<div class="i1">Oh, could I some bed encumber, oh, how quickly I would snore!</div>
<div class="i1">Oh, how I would wake the echoes with my deep sonorous snore!</div>
<div class="i6">But my vigil was not o’er.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">For as I thus thought of snoring, came a sound of liquid pouring&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">’Twas a sound that oft, when thirsty, I had heard with joy before;</div>
<div class="i1">And when it I heard repeating, thro’ the darkness sent I greeting,</div>
<div class="i1">Saying, “Who is that that’s drinking something in behind my door?”&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">For the sound came from a chamber, mine erstwhile, now mine no more&mdash;</div>
<div class="i6">“Who are you and what d’you pour?”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">But no answer came, so rising with a rashness most surprising,</div>
<div class="i1">“Sir,” said I, “or madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;</div>
<div class="i1">But the fact is I was napping, when I heard some liquid lapping,</div>
<div class="i1">Lapping, lapping, softly lapping, in behind this chamber-door.</div>
<div class="i1">Who are you in there, I pray you?”&mdash;here I opened wide the door&mdash;</div>
<div class="i6">Smell of spirits, nothing more!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Deeply that strong odour sniffing stood I “butting” there and “if-ing;”</div>
<div class="i1">Guessing, wondering, surmising who it was that I’d heard pour.</div>
<div class="i1">Still the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token;</div>
<div class="i1">But a bottle brandy-soaken I remarked upon the floor.</div>
<div class="i1">This I noticed, black and empty, lying there upon the floor&mdash;</div>
<div class="i6">Merely that, and nothing more!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">From the chamber I was turning, all my soul within me yearning</div>
<div class="i1">For a little cup of cognac: since my chilblains were so sore&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">When I heard a sound of rustling, as of some stout woman bustling&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">“Ah,” said I, “this chamber’s mystery I will linger and explore&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Stay will I another minute and its mystery explore&mdash;</div>
<div class="i6">Why I heard that brandy pour?”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Opened here a folding-door was; and in a few seconds more was</div>
<div class="i1">A full stout and snuffy matron coming towards me o’er the floor;</div>
<div class="i1">Not the least obeisance made she; not a minute stopped or stayed she,</div>
<div class="i1">But upon a chair down sitting, beckoned me to what she bore:</div>
<div class="i1">’Twas a tiny roll of flannel in her portly arms she bore&mdash;</div>
<div class="i6">Only that, and nothing more!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Then this flannel roll beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,</div>
<div class="i1">By the strange and utter contrast that it to the matron bore,</div>
<div class="i1">Sought my thoughts another channel, and I spoke unto the flannel,</div>
<div class="i1">Saying, “What art thou and wherefore art thou brought here, I implore?&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Tell me why thou art thus carried, why so gently, I implore?”</div>
<div class="i6">But it sobbed, and nothing more!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Much I marvelled at its sobbing, and my heart was quickly throbbing</div>
<div class="i1">As unto the ponderous matron said I, ‘Turn that flannel o’er!’</div>
<div class="i1">For you cannot help agreeing that no living human being</div>
<div class="i1">Ever yet beheld a bundle that could sob, and nothing more&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Ever yet a roll of flannel saw that sobbed and nothing more!”</div>
<div class="i6">Quoth the matron, “Shut the door.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Then the flannel pink unfolding, soon was I with awe beholding</div>
<div class="i1">Something like to which my eyes had never gazed upon before.</div>
<div class="i1">Nothing further then it uttered&mdash;but I mouthed awhile and stuttered</div>
<div class="i1">Till I positively muttered, “Tell me all, I would implore!”</div>
<div class="i1">Said the matron, “There is little to inform you on that score:</div>
<div class="i6">’Tis your son, and nothing more!”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“Ah,” said I, no longer dreaming, with a sudden knowledge gleaming,</div>
<div class="i1">“You’ve a monthly nurse’s seeming, and ’twas you that I heard pour;</div>
<div class="i1">Tell me, then, when I may slumber, when this room you’ll cease to cumber,</div>
<div class="i1">Since of chilblains such a number in the passage I deplore;</div>
<div class="i1">Tell me when I may turn in and cease their smarting to deplore.”</div>
<div class="i6">Quoth that woman, “Never more!”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“Woman!” said I, “nurse, how dare you? If you do not have a care, you</div>
<div class="i1">Soon will find that I can spare you, for I’ll show to you the door!”</div>
<div class="i1">But that woman, calmly sitting, and her brows engaged in knitting,</div>
<div class="i1">In a way most unbefitting took the bottle from the floor,</div>
<div class="i1">Took it up, although ’twas empty, took it up from off the floor;</div>
<div class="i6">Waved it and said, “Never more!”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“Nurse,” I shouted, “I won’t stand it; put it down, at once, unhand it!</div>
<div class="i1">As your master, I demand it, and this room to me restore;</div>
<div class="i1">Take yon saucepan from my table; clear my bed, for you are able,</div>
<div class="i1">Of your wardrobe, and the baby take where it was heretofore;</div>
<div class="i1">For I long to sink in slumber: nurse, I’m dying for a snore!”</div>
<div class="i6">Quoth that woman, “Never more!”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“Be that word our sign of parting, monthly nurse,” said I, upstarting,</div>
<div class="i1">“Get thee gone, thou Gamp outrageous, to where’er thou wast before;</div>
<div class="i1">Leave that bottle as a token of the rest that thou hast broken&mdash;</div>
<a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a><span class="pageno">49</span>
<div class="i1">Now be off&mdash;have I not spoken? Get thee gone, Gamp, there’s the door&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Take thy wardrobe from my bed, and take thyself out through that door!”</div>
<div class="i6">Quoth that woman, “Never more!”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And that monthly nurse is sitting, drinking in a way unfitting,</div>
<div class="i1">In an easy-chair luxurious just behind my chamber-door;</div>
<div class="i1">There for weeks she has been sleeping, me from my own chamber keeping;</div>
<div class="i1">Degradations on me heaping, till my heart of hearts is sore;</div>
<div class="i1">Fearing that her shadow never will be lifted from my floor,</div>
<div class="i1">And that, smelling strong of spirits, she through yonder open door</div>
<div class="i6">Shall be lifted&mdash;Never more!</div>

<div class="poemtitle"><span class="sc">The Maiden.</span></div>
<div class="i1">Once upon a summer morning, whilst I watched the sun adorning</div>
<div class="i2">All the hilltops lying round me with an ever-golden hue,</div>
<div class="i1">Suddenly I saw a maiden with a basket heavy laden,</div>
<div class="i2">Yes, a basket heavy laden with some clothes which looked like new,</div>
<div class="i2">And I cried, “My pretty maiden, these look just as good as new;</div>
<div class="i6">Have they, pray, been washed by you?”</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Ah! distinctly I remember how my soul burned like an ember,</div>
<div class="i2">As the maiden’s eyes grew brighter&mdash;eyes of such a lovely blue;</div>
<div class="i1">How her auburn tresses glistened in the sunlight while I listened,</div>
<div class="i2">Wondering how she had been christened; but her answering words were few,</div>
<div class="i2">And somehow they didn’t please me, these her answering words so few&mdash;</div>
<div class="i6">“Truly, sir, what’s that to you?”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Then I said, “O, lovely maiden, with this basket heavy laden,</div>
<div class="i2">Tell me truly, I implore thee, from what parent-stock you grew?</div>
<div class="i1">If your father is a humble, honest, labourer like the Bumble-</div>
<div class="i2">Bee that works, but does not grumble at the work he has to do?</div>
<div class="i2">Maiden did you ever grumble at the work you had to do?”</div>
<div class="i6">Quoth the maid, “What’s that to you?”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Presently my soul grew stronger, hesitating then no longer,</div>
<div class="i2">For I felt a little angry, and thus said what wasn’t true:</div>
<div class="i1">“Hark you, maid, my friend, Joe Simmen, says that all you washerwomen</div>
<div class="i2">Are as sour as any lemon, cross as any <em>ole clo’</em> Jew;</div>
<div class="i2">Tell me maiden, is it not so, that you’re like some <em>ole clo’</em> Jew?”</div>
<div class="i6">Quoth the maid “What’s that to you?”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Deep into that countenance peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,</div>
<div class="i2">Lest the girl should prove a vixen, and begin to hit me too;</div>
<div class="i1">But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,</div>
<div class="i2">And the only words there spoken were the whispered words, “Pooh! pooh!”</div>
<div class="i2">These I whispered, for I feared her, whispered just the words, “Pooh! pooh!”</div>
<div class="i6">And I knew not what to do.</div>

</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Round about myself then turning, all my soul within me burning,</div>
<div class="i2">For I did not dare to face her, as she was I knew not who;</div>
<div class="i1">I began at once to wonder how on earth I could thus blunder,</div>
<div class="i2">And why I thus should cower under these her answering words so few,</div>
<div class="i2">And I could not find a reason why her words should be so few;</div>
<div class="i6">Still I knew not what to do.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Then I glanced across my shoulder, as it were some sheltering boulder,</div>
<div class="i2">And I saw the maiden laughing, laughing till her face was blue.</div>
<div class="i1">Then I thought “’Tis now or never,” so I said (and thought it clever),</div>
<div class="i2">“Pretty maiden, did you ever have a nice young sweetheart, who</div>
<div class="i2">Was, as I am, tall and handsome? If so, prithee tell me who?”</div>
<div class="i6">Quoth the maid “What’s that to you?”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And the maiden, thus beguiling all my angry soul to smiling,</div>
<div class="i2">Made me say, “Ah! lovely maiden, fairly I’m in love with you.”</div>
<div class="i1">Then began my heart to flutter, and began my tongue to stutter,</div>
<div class="i2">And began my lips to mutter, while around me objects flew.</div>
<div class="i2">Thus I muttered, while the objects round about me swiftly flew,</div>
<div class="i6">“Maiden, I’m in love with you.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">But the maiden, sitting lonely on the velvet sod, spoke only</div>
<div class="i2">These four words when I made of her some interrogation new;</div>
<div class="i1">So upon the green grass sinking, I betook myself to linking</div>
<div class="i2">Fancy unto fancy, thinking what on earth I now should do,</div>
<div class="i2">And I asked the washer maiden, what on earth I now should do?</div>
<div class="i6">Quoth the maid “What pleases you.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“Torment!” said I, “thing of evil! you, at least, might have been civil,</div>
<div class="i2">And not given such answers to the questions I have put to you.</div>
<div class="i1">When I told you that I loved you, surely then I think I moved you,</div>
<div class="i2">And I think it had behoved you to make answers straight and true,</div>
<div class="i2">’Stead of which you gave me answers which were anything but true.”</div>
<div class="i6">Quoth the maid, “What’s that to you.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“Be these words our sign of parting, saucy maid!” I shrieked, upstarting.</div>
<div class="i2">“Get you back into the village, take these clothes along with you!</div>
<div class="i1">Leave no thread even as a token of these horrid words you’ve spoken!</div>
<div class="i2">Leave my loneliness unbroken! Take these clothes which look like new,</div>
<div class="i2">And return to where you came from, with these clothes as clean as new!”</div>
<div class="i6">Quoth the maiden, “Not for you.”</div>
<a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"></a><span class="pageno">50</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">So <em>I</em> left the washer maiden and her basket heavy laden,</div>
<div class="i2">And I hope that I may never, never more behold the two;</div>
<div class="i1">Yet my sleep is oft enchanted, and my dreams are often haunted</div>
<div class="i2">By her form when just not wanted, and the basket seems there too,</div>
<div class="i2">And she asks in tones of mockery, pointing at the basket, too,</div>
<div class="i6">“What is this, now, sir, to you?”</div>

<p><span class="sc">Galahad</span>: What do you mean by the reference to
Horace Greeley?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Zoïlus</span>: I thought everybody had heard that Greeley’s
only autograph of Poe was a signature to a promissory note
for fifty dollars. He offers to sell it for half the money.

Now, I don’t mean to be wicked, and to do nothing with
the dead except bone ’em, but when such a cue pops into
one’s mind, what is one to do?</p>

<p><span class="sc">The Ancient</span>: O, I think you’re still within decent
limits! There was a congenital twist about poor Poe. We
can’t entirely condone his faults, yet we stretch our charity
so as to cover as much as possible. His poetry has a hectic
flush, a strange, fascinating, narcotic quality, which belongs
to him alone. Baudelaire and Swinburne after him have
been trying to surpass him by increasing the dose; but his
Muse is the natural Pythia, inheriting her convulsions,
while they eat all sorts of insane roots to produce theirs.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Galahad</span> (<i>eagerly</i>): Did you ever know him?</p>

<p><span class="sc">The Ancient</span>: I met him two or three times, heard him
lecture once (his enunciation was exquisite), and saw him
now and then in Broadway,&mdash;enough to satisfy me that there
were two men in him: one, a refined gentleman, an aspiring
soul, an artist among those who had little sense of literary
art; the other<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="sc">Zoïlus</span>: Go on!</p>

<p><span class="sc">The Ancient</span>: “Built his nest with the birds of night.”
No more of that!</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="i1">Once upon an evening bleary,</div>
<div class="i1">While I sat me dreamy, dreary,</div>
<div class="i1">In the sunshine, thinking over</div>
<div class="i2">Things that passed in days of yore;</div>
<div class="i1">While I nodded, nearly sleeping,</div>
<div class="i1">Gently came a something creeping</div>
<div class="i1">Up my back, like water seeping&mdash;</div>
<div class="i2">Seeping upward from the floor.</div>
<div class="i2">“’Tis a cooling breeze,” I muttered,</div>
<div class="i2">From the regions ’neath the floor&mdash;</div>
<div class="i2">Only this, and nothing more.”</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Ah! distinctly I remember</div>
<div class="i1">It was in that wet September,</div>
<div class="i1">When the earth and every member</div>
<div class="i2">Of creation that it bore</div>
<div class="i1">Had for days and weeks been soaking</div>
<div class="i1">In the meanest, most provoking</div>
<div class="i1">Foggy rains that, without joking,</div>
<div class="i2">We had ever seen before;</div>
<div class="i1">So I knew it must be very</div>
<div class="i2">Cold and damp beneath the floor&mdash;</div>
<div class="i2">Very cold beneath the floor.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">So I sat me nearly napping,</div>
<div class="i1">In the sunshine, stretching, gaping,</div>
<div class="i1">Craving water, but delighted</div>
<div class="i2">With the breeze from ’neath the floor,</div>
<div class="i1">Till I found me waxing colder,</div>
<div class="i1">And the stretching growing bolder,</div>
<div class="i1">And myself a feeling older&mdash;</div>
<div class="i2">Older than I’d felt before;</div>
<div class="i1">Feeling that my joints were stiffer</div>
<div class="i2">Than they were in days of yore&mdash;</div>
<div class="i2">Stiffer than they’d been before.</div>
<a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"></a><span class="pageno">51</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">All along my back the creeping</div>
<div class="i1">Soon gave place to rushing, leaping,</div>
<div class="i1">As if countless frozen demons</div>
<div class="i2">Had concluded to explore</div>
<div class="i1">All the cavities&mdash;the “varmints”&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">’Twixt me and my nether garments,</div>
<div class="i1">Up into my hair and downward</div>
<div class="i2">Through my boots into the floor;</div>
<div class="i1">Then I found myself a shaking,</div>
<div class="i2">Gently first, but more and more&mdash;</div>
<div class="i2">Every moment more and more.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">’Twas the “ager,” and it shook me</div>
<div class="i1">Into many clothes, and took me</div>
<div class="i1">Shaking to the kitchen&mdash;every</div>
<div class="i2">Place where there was warmth in store;</div>
<div class="i1">Shaking till the dishes clattered,</div>
<div class="i1">Shaking till the tea was spattered,</div>
<div class="i1">Shaking, and with all my warming</div>
<div class="i2">Feeling colder than before;</div>
<div class="i1">Shaking till it had exhausted</div>
<div class="i2">All its powers to shake me more&mdash;</div>
<div class="i2">Till it could not shake me more.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Then it rested till the morrow,</div>
<div class="i1">Then resumed with all the horror</div>
<div class="i1">That it had the face to borrow,</div>
<div class="i2">Shaking, shaking as before;</div>
<div class="i1">And from that day in September&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Day that I shall long remember&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">It has made diurnal visits,</div>
<div class="i2">Shaking, shaking, oh so sore!</div>
<div class="i1">Shaking off my boots, and shaking</div>
<div class="i2">Me to bed, if nothing more&mdash;</div>
<div class="i2">Fully this, if nothing more.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And to-day the swallows flitting</div>
<div class="i1">Round my cottage see me sitting</div>
<div class="i1">Moodily within the sunshine</div>
<div class="i2">Just inside my silent door,</div>
<div class="i1">Waiting for the ages, seeming</div>
<div class="i1">Like a man forever dreaming,</div>
<div class="i1">And the sunlight on me streaming</div>
<div class="i2">Throws no shadows on the floor;</div>
<div class="i1">For I am too thin and sallow</div>
<div class="i2">To make shadows on the floor;</div>
<div class="i2">’Nary shadow&mdash;any more!</div>

<div class="poemtitle"><span class="sc">The Chancellor of the Exchequer<br />and the Surplus.</span></div>
<div class="i1">Lately on a midnight dreary, whilst I studied, though so weary,</div>
<div class="i1">Several sheets of close-writ figures I had gone through times before;</div>
<div class="i1">Whilst I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,</div>
<div class="i1">As of some one gently rapping, rapping at the Treasury door.</div>
<div class="i1">“Is that Kempe?” I slowly mutter’d. “If it is, pray leave the door&mdash;</div>
<div class="i6">I shall want you here no more!”</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Oh! distinctly I remember, for it happen’d this December</div>
<div class="i1">And each separate, dying ember seem’d a figure on the floor.</div>
<div class="i1">Nervously I wish’d the morrow; for so far I’d failed to borrow&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">From the Bank of England borrow&mdash;at the same rate as before&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">At the same low rate of interest I had borrow’d at before&mdash;</div>
<div class="i6">They would lend at Two no more.</div>

</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And I had a sort of notion that this fact was known to Goschen,</div>
<div class="i1">Whilst the dread of Childers fill’d me with a fear not felt before,</div>
<div class="i1">So that now to still the beating of my heart I’d been repeating:</div>
<div class="i1">“P’rhaps some luck may yet befall you ere you stand upon the floor&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Stand next April with your Budget at the table on the floor&mdash;</div>
<div class="i6">And a Surplus yet restore!”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Presently the rap was stronger; hesitating then no longer,</div>
<div class="i1">“Kempe!” said I, “or Law, or Lingen, is that you outside my door?</div>
<div class="i1">If it be, pray cease your tapping; if you have no cause for rapping,</div>
<div class="i1">Cease, and let me strike my balance ere I sleep, I you implore.</div>
<div class="i1">Do come in if you are out there!” Here I open’d wide the door&mdash;</div>
<div class="i6">Darkness there, and nothing more.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Deep into the darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,</div>
<div class="i1">Seeing ghosts of former Budgets&mdash;Gladstone’s Budgets&mdash;o’er me soar;</div>
<div class="i1">But the silence was unbroken, and of Kempe I saw no token;</div>
<div class="i1">He had gone with Law and Lingen shortly after half-past four.</div>
<div class="i1">So I “H-s-s-h’d”&mdash;perchance assuming there were cats about the floor&mdash;</div>
<div class="i6">Merely cats, and nothing more.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Back into my room returning, where two composites were burning,</div>
<div class="i1">Soon again I heard a tapping, something louder than before.</div>
<div class="i1">“’Tis too soon for chimney-sweeper; can it be the office-keeper?”</div>
<div class="i1">This I said, and once more rising, tried the mystery to explore.</div>
<div class="i1">“I will go and try the window, for there’s no one at the door”&mdash;</div>
<div class="i6">This I said, and nothing more.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Open then I flung the shutter, when with quite a fussy flutter,</div>
<div class="i1">In there stalk’d a handsome Surplus of the Liberal years of yore;</div>
<div class="i1">Not the least obeisance made it, not a minute stopp’d or stay’d it,</div>
<div class="i1">But&mdash;nor tried I to dissuade it&mdash;hopp’d on something on the floor;</div>
<div class="i1">Hopp’d upon my rough-drawn Budget, which I’d thrown upon the floor&mdash;</div>
<div class="i6">Hopp’d, then sat; and nothing more!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Then this welcome guest beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,</div>
<div class="i1">By the cheery and contented cast of countenance it wore;</div>
<div class="i1">“Welcome,” said I, “Surplus comely! though you have arrived so ‘rumly,’</div>
<div class="i1">For ’tis some years since a Budget drawn by me a Surplus bore;</div>
<div class="i1">Let this be a happy omen&mdash;that they’ll come as heretofore!”</div>
<div class="i6">Quoth the Surplus&mdash;“Nevermore!”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Much I marvell’d that so plainly it should answer, and so sanely;</div>
<div class="i1">Though in sooth I hoped its answer little relevancy bore.</div>
<div class="i1">For ’t had fill’d my heart with pleasure, and with ecstacy past measure</div>
<a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a><span class="pageno">52</span>
<div class="i1">Once again to see a Surplus come within the Treasury door,</div>
<div class="i1">To observe a real Surplus on my Budget on the floor,</div>
<div class="i6">Like the one in ’Seventy-four.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">But the Surplus, sitting lonely on my Budget draft, spake only</div>
<div class="i1">That one word already mention’d&mdash;I refer to “Nevermore.”</div>
<div class="i1">And not for its answer caring, and by no means yet despairing,</div>
<div class="i1">I took heart and said: “Six millions was there left in ’Seventy-four;</div>
<div class="i1">When shall I next get a Surplus large as that in ’Seventy-four?”</div>
<div class="i6">Quoth my guest: “Why, nevermore!”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">But this time ’twas not contented with the word I so resented,</div>
<div class="i1">But went on and said: “Oh, Northcote, ruin is for you in store!</div>
<div class="i1">Thanks to your mysterious master, dearth will follow on disaster,</div>
<div class="i1">Ills will follow fast and faster, trade will wholly leave your shore;</div>
<div class="i1">And the people, so impoverish’d, will your taxes pay no more.</div>
<div class="i6">Debt will haunt you more and more!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“Now your revenue is sinking&mdash;it’s no use the matter blinking,</div>
<div class="i1">Every day, you know, Sir Stafford, your big deficit grows more,</div>
<div class="i1">And you have to borrow, borrow (three more millions, eh, to-morrow?)</div>
<div class="i1">You have now a floating debt that’s ten times what it was of yore;</div>
<div class="i1">Think upon the splendid Budget Gladstone left in ’Seventy-four,</div>
<div class="i6">And your muddle now deplore!”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">As the Surplus thus declaiming, me to blushes deep was shaming,</div>
<div class="i1">Straight I wheel’d my cushion’d seat in front the Budget on the floor,</div>
<div class="i1">Sat on the morocco padding, and betook myself to adding</div>
<div class="i1">Figure unto figure, madding though the look the total bore;</div>
<div class="i1">Whilst that grim, ungainly, ghastly Surplus still upon the floor</div>
<div class="i6">Went on croaking: “Nevermore!”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“Surplus!” said I, “by thy figure, which methinks I see grow bigger,</div>
<div class="i1">Whether Gladstone sent, or whether Fate has toss’d thee here to bore,</div>
<div class="i1">Tell me, desperate and daunted, by a score of failures haunted,</div>
<div class="i1">Soon by Childers to be taunted, tell me, tell me, I implore,</div>
<div class="i1">Is there&mdash;can I&mdash;shall I&mdash;ever get things straight&mdash;say, I implore?”</div>
<div class="i6">Quoth the Surplus: “Nevermore!”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“Surplus!” said I, “much I question, if I don’t to indigestion</div>
<div class="i1">Owe the vision of thy presence; still I’d ask thee this once more:</div>
<div class="i1">In the name of Ewart Gladstone, whose finance I did adore,</div>
<div class="i1">Tell me, here with debt so laden, if, before I go to Aidenn,</div>
<div class="i1">I shall ever make a Budget with a Surplus, as of yore?</div>
<div class="i1">Shall I e’er announce a Surplus from my place upon the floor?”</div>
<div class="i6">Quoth the Surplus: “Nevermore!”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“Be that word our sign of parting, cruel thing!” I cried, upstarting;</div>
<div class="i1">“Get thee back to Mr. Gladstone, who created thee of yore;</div>
<div class="i1">Go, and leave behind no token of the words that thou hast spoken;</div>
<div class="i1">Leave my vigil here unbroken, quit my Budget on the floor!</div>
<div class="i1">Take thy figure off my Budget, lying there upon the floor.”</div>
<div class="i6">Quoth the Surplus: “Nevermore!”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“No, I will not think of flitting, but still sitting, ever sitting,</div>
<div class="i1">On thy wretched, feeble Budgets, on the table or the floor,</div>
<div class="i1">Will remind thee of the figure, sometimes less and sometimes bigger,</div>
<div class="i1">Of the noble Gladstone’s Surplus, always left in years of yore</div>
<div class="i1">Yes, I’ll always stay and haunt you&mdash;always stay and ever taunt you&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">As you draw up hopeless Budgets, and then throw them on the floor;</div>
<div class="i1">And my figure you shall ever see upon your study floor&mdash;</div>
<div class="i6">I will leave you nevermore!”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And it doubtless had been sitting still, nor shown a sign of flitting&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Had I not with sudden impulse started, falling by the door,</div>
<div class="i1">And discover’d, slowly rising&mdash;what is not at all surprising&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">That my composites were out, whilst daylight stream’d across the floor,</div>
<div class="i1">Then I knew I had been dreaming, but my brain continued teeming</div>
<div class="i1">With the vision, and the Surplus that had come from years of yore,</div>
<div class="i1">And my thoughts on what that Surplus said whilst there upon my floor</div>
<div class="i6">Will be fixèd evermore!</div>

<div class="poemtitle"><span class="sc">The Raven.</span><br />(<i>A Version, respectfully dedicated to the Duke of Somerset.</i>)</div>
<div class="i1">Late, upon a midnight dreary, as I pondered, chill but cheery,</div>
<div class="i1">Over certain prosy volumes of Contemporary lore&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">’Midst prophetic pages prowling, suddenly I heard a growling,</div>
<div class="i1">As of something faintly howling, howling at my chamber-door.</div>
<div class="i1">“’Tis some poor stray tyke,” I muttered, “howling at my chamber-door;</div>
<div class="i6">Only that, and nothing more.”</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Eugh! distinctly I remember it was in the cold December,</div>
<div class="i1">And my fire to its last ember burned, while outer blasts did roar.</div>
<div class="i1">Fearfully I funked the morrow, vainly I had sought to borrow</div>
<div class="i1">From my friends, or, to my sorrow, add to my coal-merchant’s score&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">To that swollen, heavy-laden thing poor devils call a “score”&mdash;</div>
<div class="i6">To be settled&mdash;nevermore.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And the windy, wild, uncertain flapping of my window curtain</div>
<div class="i1">Filled me, thrilled me with fantastic fancies never known before;</div>
<div class="i1">So that, now, to check the cheating of my mind I stood repeating,</div>
<div class="i1">“’Tis that <span class="sc">Jones’s</span> dog entreating entrance at my chamber-door&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Bibulous <span class="sc">Jones’s</span> pug entreating entrance at my chamber-door,&mdash;</div>
<div class="i6">Only that, and nothing more.”</div>
<a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a><span class="pageno">53</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Presently the sound grew stronger. Hesitating then no longer,</div>
<div class="i1">“Tyke,” said I, “low mongrel, truly this intrusion is a bore;</div>
<div class="i1">Where the deuce have you been prowling, that so late you come a howling,</div>
<div class="i1">Keeping up this nasty growling, growling at my chamber-door?</div>
<div class="i1">I was hardly sure I heard you.” Here I open flung the door,&mdash;</div>
<div class="i6">Darkness there, and nothing more!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Back into my chamber turning, where my lamp was dimly burning,</div>
<div class="i1">Soon again I heard a growling, something louder than before.</div>
<div class="i1">“Surely,” said I, “surely, that is something stirring at my lattice,</div>
<div class="i1">Let me see if ghost or cat ’tis, and this mystery explore.</div>
<div class="i1">Pooh! <em>I</em> have it, what a duffer, what a booby, to be sure!</div>
<div class="i6">’Tis the wind, and nothing more!”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Open here I flung the casement, when, to my extreme amazement,</div>
<div class="i1">In there stepped a rusty Raven of the “glorious days of yore.”</div>
<div class="i1">Not the least obeisance dropped he, not an instant stayed or stopped he,</div>
<div class="i1">But, like ghoul who hopped and flopped, he perched above my chamber door&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">On a plaster bust of <span class="sc">Dizzy</span> standing o’er my chamber-door&mdash;</div>
<div class="i6">Perched and sat, and&mdash;nothing more!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Then this seedy bird beguiling my chilled features into smiling,</div>
<div class="i1">By the grave lugubrious grimness of the solemn phiz he wore,</div>
<div class="i1">“Thou art welcome to this haven,” said I, “foul, bedraggled, shaven,</div>
<div class="i1">Hopeless-looking ancient Raven, croaking as of days of yore.</div>
<div class="i1">Tell me what thy lordly name is, is or was, in days of yore.”</div>
<div class="i6">Quoth the Raven, “Nevermore!”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Much I marvelled this most sickly fowl to hear respond so quickly,</div>
<div class="i1">Though the <em>nomen</em> was a rum one, it a certain aptness bore,</div>
<div class="i1">As to those dull dupes of folly and foreboding melancholy,</div>
<div class="i1">Hopeful seldom, never jolly, doting on those days of yore,&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Who esteem the present hopeless, utter failure or next door&mdash;</div>
<div class="i6">To be mended nevermore!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">But the Raven, squatting lonely on the plaster bust spoke only</div>
<div class="i1">That one word, as though his soul in doldrums he would thus outpour.</div>
<div class="i1">Nothing further then he uttered, though his spirit seemed sore fluttered.</div>
<div class="i1">“Come!” I said, or rather muttered, “you’re dyspeptic&mdash;’tis a bore,</div>
<div class="i1">But to-morrow you’ll be better, sleep will your lost tone restore.”</div>
<div class="i6">Quoth the Raven, “Nevermore!”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Struck to find the silence broken by reply so patly spoken,</div>
<div class="i1">“Doubtless,” said I, “this one word, now, is his only stock and store,</div>
<div class="i1">Caught from pessimistic master, who in progress saw disaster,</div>
<div class="i1">Coming fast and coming faster, till his wails one burden bore,&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Till his sad vaticinations one unvarying burden bore,</div>
<div class="i6">This same Raven’s “Nevermore!”</div>

</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">But the Raven still beguiling my amused soul into smiling,</div>
<div class="i1">Straight I wheeled my easy-chair in front of bird, and bust, and door;</div>
<div class="i1">Then, upon the cushion sinking, thought to thought by fancy linking,</div>
<div class="i1">I employed my brains in thinking what this black and feathered bore,</div>
<div class="i1">Like all gaunt funereal vaunters of those precious days of yore,</div>
<div class="i6">Meant by croaking “Nevermore!”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Then methought the air grew denser, darkened as by cynic censor,</div>
<div class="i1">Some <span class="sc">Cassandra</span> whose forecastings are of evil days in store.</div>
<div class="i1">“Croak no more!” I cried. “Content thee with the gifts the gods have sent thee;</div>
<div class="i1">Give us respite and nepenthe from sad dreams of days of yore!</div>
<div class="i1">Let us quaff hope’s sweet nepenthe, and forget those days of yore!”</div>
<div class="i6">Quoth the Raven, “Nevermore!”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“Prophet,” said I, “of things evil! ‘Things are going to the devil,’</div>
<div class="i1">Is the formula of fogies, I have heard that bosh before;</div>
<div class="i1">Times look dark, but hearts undaunted find the future still enchanted,</div>
<div class="i1">With fair visions such as haunted valiant souls in days of yore.</div>
<div class="i1">Can’t you, <em>can’t</em> you look less glum? Keep up your pecker, I implore.”</div>
<div class="i6">Quoth the Raven&mdash;“Nevermore!”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“Prophet,” said I, “of things evil, I don’t wish to be uncivil,</div>
<div class="i1">But the heavens still bend above us, happy days are still in store;</div>
<div class="i1">All are not with megrims laden, still the future holds its Aidenn,</div>
<div class="i1">For brave youth and beauteous maiden; prophets <em>have</em> been wrong before,</div>
<div class="i1">Generally <em>are</em>, in fact; why can’t they learn, and cease to bore?”</div>
<div class="i6">Quoth the Raven, “Nevermore!”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“Then, look here! we’d best be parting, croaking fowl!” I cried, upstarting,</div>
<div class="i1">“You had better find your way to some Fools’ Paradise’s shore!</div>

<div class="poemtitle"><span class="sc">The Gold Digger.</span></div>
<div class="i1">Once upon an evening dreary, a gold-digger, tired and weary,</div>
<div class="i1">Cogitated very sadly, brain and bone and heart were sore,</div>
<div class="i1">For no gold came by his toiling, unkind fate seemed ever foiling</div>
<a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a><span class="pageno">54</span>
<div class="i1">All his toilsome, weary efforts, and the keeper of the store</div>
<div class="i1">Had pitilessly stopped his credit; quoth the keeper of the store,</div>
<div class="i6">“I can’t tucker you no more.”</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Wild and gloomy thoughts were tumbling through his head and set him grumbling,</div>
<div class="i1">And his voice in accents mumbling ’gan the harsh fates to implore,</div>
<div class="i1">That they’d come to some decision, either make him some provision,</div>
<div class="i1">Or at once their utmost fury on his willing head outpour&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">“Either make me some provision, or your deadliest vials pour”&mdash;</div>
<div class="i6">He kept crying o’er and o’er.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Swearing, snapping, musing, napping, presently there came a tapping,</div>
<div class="i1">Quite an unaccustomed tapping at this fate-tossed digger’s door,</div>
<div class="i1">And it roused him from his musing with expectancy confusing,</div>
<div class="i1">Made him listen to that tapping on the night’s Plutonian shore,</div>
<div class="i1">Wond’ring what could cause that tapping on the night’s Plutonian shore,</div>
<div class="i6">Wondering, guessing, more and more.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Softly then he seized a waddy, quietly he bore his body</div>
<div class="i1">To that space within his hut, immediately behind the door;</div>
<div class="i1">And with easiest, gentlest motion, like the wave of summer ocean,</div>
<div class="i1">He hove up the latch that barred all ingress to his shanty floor,</div>
<div class="i1">Hove it up, and grasped his waddy, scanned the night’s Plutonian shore,</div>
<div class="i6">Saw the light, and nothing more.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Then cried he, “What shicer is it pays me this mysterious visit?</div>
<div class="i1">Is’t a snake or is’t a wild dog? either sneak I do abhor,</div>
<div class="i1">Well! I don’t know about funking, but I’ll just lie down my bunk in,</div>
<div class="i1">And I’ll leave the door wide open, open to what may explore</div>
<div class="i1">The old hut, and while exploring, if the explorer don’t get sore,</div>
<div class="i6">Cooey on me, nevermore.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">From the darkness came a fluttering, and a sort of subdued muttering</div>
<div class="i1">That developed into stuttering, stuttering at the open door;</div>
<div class="i1">And a lovely Cochin China, impudent as any Dinah,</div>
<div class="i1">Strutted proudly o’er the threshold like as he’d been there before,</div>
<div class="i1">Just as though he had a right that came all other rights before,</div>
<div class="i6">A right that still demanded more.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">But a different opinion reigned without that small dominion;</div>
<div class="i1">There a calm recumbent digger eyed the proud bird o’er and o’er,</div>
<div class="i1">And then stealthily arising, with a cunning most surprising,</div>
<div class="i1">Ere Chanticleer had perceived it, he had fastened to the door;</div>
<div class="i1">Had made the door so very fast that the chanticleer’s uproar</div>
<div class="i6">Might undo it, nevermore.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Then said he, “This bird celestial may I civilly request he’ll</div>
<div class="i1">Now disclose the cause of his nocturnal tapping at my door?</div>
<div class="i1">Say! hath my good angel sent thee? Flutter not, nay, nay, content thee,</div>
<div class="i1">Thou shalt have as warm a welcome as e’er cocky had before,</div>
<div class="i1">Have a regular hot old welcome, such as others had before;</div>
<div class="i6">I can offer nothing more.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Ah! the bird was very wary, and of eloquence quite chary,</div>
<div class="i1">No clear answer did it make him as it dodged about the floor,</div>
<div class="i1">Never thanked him for his kindness, but with worse than colour blindness,</div>
<div class="i1">It refused to see the goodness of the digger o’er and o’er,</div>
<div class="i1">Really flew from his advances, as esteeming him a bore,</div>
<div class="i6">And desiring such no more.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Spare my muse a dire narration, take the simple intimation</div>
<div class="i1">That by fell decapitation, Cocky weltered in his gore.</div>
<div class="i1">His shrill clarion brought to silence by a digger’s ruthless violence,</div>
<div class="i1">Never more at dawn of morning, or at close of day might pour</div>
<div class="i1">Its clear notes upon the air; might no matin solo pour;</div>
<div class="i6">Silenced quite for evermore.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Quite soon a mouth-moistening aroma, such as a famous cook’s diploma</div>
<div class="i1">Might certify that famed cook’s skill could draw from viands in his store,</div>
<div class="i1">Filled the hut. The pot was bubbling, Cochin China’s toil and troubling</div>
<div class="i1">Were at an end, and he was yielding grateful broth from every pore,</div>
<div class="i1">Yielding broth fit for a warden, that should our digger’s strength restore,</div>
<div class="i6">And make him a good feed once more.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">’Twas no ardour scientific of immense results prolific,</div>
<div class="i1">Nor a questioning of his fortunes by the ancient heathen lore,</div>
<div class="i1">Still our much depressed hero, whose luck surely was at zero,</div>
<div class="i1">Was examining quite closely Cocky’s crop upon the floor,</div>
<div class="i1">Was inspecting it minutely on his knees upon the floor,</div>
<div class="i6">Close and closer, more and more.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Then he rose in great elation, no swell owner of a station</div>
<div class="i1">Could wear a more triumphant air than now our miner wore,</div>
<div class="i1">For while he had been dissecting he’d been curiously prospecting,</div>
<div class="i1">And Cocky’s crop had yielded yellow grains of golden ore.</div>
<div class="i1">“No bad prospect,” quoth our miner, “a good show of golden ore,</div>
<div class="i6">And around there must be more.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">When the morrow’s sun had lighted up the heavens, our miner dighted</div>
<div class="i1">In his clay-stained looking raiment sought the ground the fowls pecked o’er,</div>
<div class="i1">And with them he went a picking, and by dint of closely sticking</div>
<div class="i1">To his feathered mates he picked up quite a lot of golden ore&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Picked up nuggets large as brickbats, glorious lumps of golden ore,</div>
<div class="i6">Made a pile, and nothing more.</div>

<div class="i1">Heeding not where I was going, I had wandered, all unknowing,</div>
<div class="i1">Where a river gently flowing caught the radiant ruby-streak;</div>

<div class="i1">Set me classically styling it with Latin names and Greek.</div>
<div class="i1">Names Idalian and Castalian such as lovers of the Greek,</div>
<div class="i6">Roll like quids within their cheek.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">On its marge was many a burrow, many a mound, and many a furrow,</div>

<p>In 1881 a charming little volume of Essays,
entitled, “<cite>Waifs</cite>,” was published by Messrs.
Maclehose, of Glasgow. Mr. William Tait
Ross, the author of these papers is well
known in the northern capitals for his
writings, published under the <i>nom de plume</i>
of Herbert Martyne. One of the most humorous
chapters in “Waifs” is entitled <cite>A Séance with a
Sequel</cite>, which recounts the author’s experiences at
a spiritualistic meeting in Glasgow. He there
interviews the ghost of one of the geese who
saved Rome; the spirit of a duck who sailed in
Noah’s Ark; the spirit of the late lamented
Cock Robin; of the mouse turned over by
Robbie Burns’s plough; and of the donkey
celebrated by the Poet Coleridge.</p>

<p>There is a good deal of dry humour in their
replies, but the <i>séance</i> comes to an untimely
end, owing to a wild outburst of spiritual
enthusiasm on the part of the table used for
communicating with the spirits.</p>

<p>This excitable piece of furniture suddenly
made for the door, and was with difficulty
restrained by four strong men. One of the party
then getting alarmed, turned on the gas; in a
moment all the commotion ceased; and so the
séance ended.</p>

<p>“I will add,” says the author, “nothing by
way of comment, except this, that the answers
obtained from the various spirits seem to me to
be even more sensible and important than those
obtained at any <i>séance</i> recorded in the annals of
spirit rapping.”</p>

<p>The chapter concludes with the following
verses in imitation of “The Raven,” entitled<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="i1">Lately on a midnight dreary,</div>
<div class="i1">Sitting by the fire so cheery,</div>
<div class="i1">Listening to the storm that beat and blew</div>
<div class="i1">With blustering gust and roar;</div>
<div class="i1">While I sat serenely smoking,</div>
<div class="i1">Suddenly there came a knocking</div>
<div class="i1">As of some one rudely poking,</div>
<a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a><span class="pageno">56</span>
<div class="i1">Poking at my chamber-door&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">“’Tis some dirty ill-bred spirit</div>
<div class="i1">Knocking at my chamber-door&mdash;</div>
<div class="i6">Only that, and nothing more.”</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">But to face the audacious knocker,</div>
<div class="i1">I seized the shining poker,</div>
<div class="i1">While my heart went jumping, thumping,</div>
<div class="i1">As I never felt before;</div>
<div class="i1">For through the storm’s loud shrieking</div>
<div class="i1">I heard high voices speaking&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">’Tis some thief’s ghost that is sneaking</div>
<div class="i1">On the outside of the door&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Some vile spirit entrance seeking</div>
<div class="i1">By the keyhole of the door&mdash;</div>
<div class="i6">This, perhaps, and nothing more.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Hesitating then no longer,</div>
<div class="i1">Presently my legs grew stronger,</div>
<div class="i1">And, brandishing the poker,</div>
<div class="i1">I strode towards the door;</div>
<div class="i1">When, without one word of fable,</div>
<div class="i1">The ponderous parlour-table</div>
<div class="i1">Marched as fast as it was able</div>
<div class="i1">Right across the parlour floor;</div>
<div class="i1">Danced across the room, and then assumed</div>
<div class="i1">Its post beside the door&mdash;</div>
<div class="i6">Which is true, and something more.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Outside louder grew the knockings,</div>
<div class="i1">Till I shook within my stockings,</div>
<div class="i1">And then there came a thundering bang,</div>
<div class="i1">Far louder than before;</div>
<div class="i1">While the ponderous parlour table</div>
<div class="i1">Danced as fast as it was able</div>
<div class="i1">Kicking up a noise like Babel,</div>
<div class="i1">Which I could not well explore;</div>
<div class="i1">Let my legs be firm a moment,</div>
<div class="i1">And this mystery explore&mdash;</div>
<div class="i6">’Tis a drunken man, no more.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">For now I well remember,</div>
<div class="i1">In the dark days of December,</div>
<div class="i1">Full many a drouthy crony</div>
<div class="i1">Proceeds from door to door&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Pouring forth the flowing whiskey,</div>
<div class="i1">And, thereby getting frisky,</div>
<div class="i1">Plays many a curious plisky,</div>
<div class="i1">And raises many a splore&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">It may be spirit rappers</div>
<div class="i1">On t’other side the door&mdash;</div>
<div class="i6">Only that, and nothing more.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">So pulling up my breeches,</div>
<div class="i1">With many tugs and hitches,</div>
<div class="i1">I turned the key within the lock</div>
<div class="i1">And opened wide the door,</div>
<div class="i1">When arose a mighty bawling,</div>
<div class="i1">And a sudden stick came mauling,</div>
<div class="i1">That sent me quickly sprawling,</div>
<div class="i1">Sprawling on the parlour floor;</div>
<div class="i1">And I said <em>that</em> spirit rapping</div>
<div class="i1">I very much deplore&mdash;</div>
<div class="i6">I think I rather swore.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And, shouting for a bobby,</div>
<div class="i1">Till my voice rang through the lobby,</div>
<div class="i1">I made efforts to collect myself</div>
<div class="i1">Lying spilt upon the floor;</div>
<div class="i1">But it is a fact outrageous</div>
<div class="i1">That no guardian beak courageous,</div>
<div class="i1">With whiskers so umbrageous,</div>
<div class="i1">Hears, however loud you roar;</div>
<div class="i1">So, assisted by the poker,</div>
<div class="i1">I crawled towards the door&mdash;</div>
<div class="i6">Darkness there, and nothing more.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Still the table it kept prancing,</div>
<div class="i1">And a private hornpipe dancing,</div>
<div class="i1">As if its soul rejoiced to see</div>
<div class="i1">The sufferings that I bore.</div>
<div class="i1">Wrathful at the wooden joker,</div>
<div class="i1">I smashed it with the poker,</div>
<div class="i1">When the loud tumultuous knocker</div>
<div class="i1">Fled from my chamber door,</div>
<div class="i1">Shouting out, to spirit rappers,</div>
<div class="i1">“Never open wide your door any more.”</div>

<div class="poemtitle"><span class="sc">The Drama Despondent!</span><br />(<i>A Poe-etical Parody.</i>)</div>
<div class="i1">As one evening in my study, seated by the firelight ruddy,</div>
<div class="i1">I was busily absorbing portions of dramatic lore,</div>
<div class="i1">Suddenly I heard a creaking, as of some one slyly sneaking</div>
<div class="i1">(Setting both the hinges squeaking), sneaking through my study door.</div>
<div class="i1">And I murmured, <i>sotto voce</i>, “Who’s that fiddling with the door?</div>
<div class="i6">Doubtless some unwelcome bore!”</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“Come in!” I sternly muttered, while my breast with anger fluttered,</div>
<div class="i1">When there sidled in a Figure, such as ne’er was seen before;</div>
<div class="i1">Like some stagey apparition, in a woe-begone condition&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">And it took up its position just inside my chamber-door.</div>
<div class="i1">“What might be your name?” I asked it. And it answered from the door&mdash;</div>
<div class="i6">“I’m the Drama!”&mdash;nothing more!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“Oh, indeed!” I said, politely. “Take a chair!” but that unsightly,</div>
<div class="i1">Not to say dejected Figure, an unwilling manner bore.</div>
<div class="i1">I remarked, “You seem in sorrow,&mdash;still bear up, perhaps to-morrow</div>
<div class="i1">(Though some trouble has beset you, which at present you deplore)</div>
<div class="i1">You may meet with better fortune, and be brilliant as of yore.”</div>
<div class="i6">Quoth the Drama, “Nevermore!”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“Why this tone of bitter anguish?” I inquired; “you seem to languish</div>
<div class="i1">’Neath some very dreadful burden; state the reason, I implore!</div>
<div class="i1">Tell me plainly, now, what is it, that has caused this sudden visit&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Why the unexpected entrance of your figure through my door?</div>
<div class="i1">Why that stagey exclamation that you uttered just before,&mdash;</div>
<div class="i6">That expression, ‘Nevermore?’”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Still it groaned, and I retreated, as that sentence it repeated.</div>
<div class="i1">“What! again?” I said. “Pray, drop it; though your grief is doubtless sore,</div>
<div class="i1"><em>You</em> can’t help trash being written for the theatres of Britain</div>
<a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a><span class="pageno">57</span>
<div class="i1">And ‘swells’ won’t be <em>always</em> waiting for their ‘pets’ at each stage-door,</div>
<div class="i1">And ere long the undressed syrens, may be swept away galore.”</div>
<div class="i6">Quoth the Drama, “Nevermore!”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Then the poor old Drama, sneering, took the cue for disappearing,&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">And it pulled its mantle round it, and stalked slowly to the door&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">And its groan was something fearful, as it said in accents tearful,</div>
<div class="i1">As it sadly bent its optics on the carpet-covered floor&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">“Look here, old poetic party, I shall bet you ten to four,&mdash;</div>
<div class="i6">’Twill be better, Nevermore!&mdash;</div>
<div class="i6">That is, hardly evermore!”</div>

<div class="i1">In the dusk, within my chamber, I sat and sadly pondered&mdash;</div>
<div class="i2">Pondered o’er life’s problems with my hand upon my brow.</div>
<div class="i1">“When,” I asked, “will adverse fortune cease to torment and oppress me?”</div>
<div class="i2">A voice from out the window, shrill and piercing, answered, “<em>Now!</em>”</div>
<div class="i1">Thrilled and startled by the answer, coming from an unknown being,</div>
<div class="i2">I said again: “If blessing is in store, oh tell me how</div>
<div class="i1">Release will come, and joy and peace? Say, when, when will it be?”</div>
<div class="i1">And through the open casement promptly came the answer “<em>N-n-now!</em>”</div>
<div class="i1">Half in fear and half in frenzy, for methought the being mocked me,</div>
<div class="i2">I said: “Unlock the mystery of my fate, or else I vow</div>
<div class="i1">To curse thee for thy falseness. Tell me when I shall have blessing.”</div>
<div class="i2">The weird, shrill voice responded still, as ever, only “<em>N-n-ow-w!</em>”</div>
<div class="i1">To my feet I sprang in anger, flinging wide the casement shutter:</div>
<div class="i2">“Djinn!” I shrieked, “or devil, or angelic being thou</div>

<p class="hanging">(<cite>A November Night’s Vision, after reading Edgar Poe and
the Earl of Dunraven’s Address on “Fair Trade,” delivered
by him, as President of the National Fair Trade
League, at Sheffield, on November</cite> 12<i>th</i>, 1884.)</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="i1">Once upon a midnight dreary, as I pondered weak and weary</div>
<div class="i1">Over many a dry and tedious tome of economic lore,</div>
<div class="i1">Whilst I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a snapping</div>
<div class="i1">As of some small terrier yapping, yapping at my study-door,</div>
<div class="i1">’Tis old <em>Ponto</em> there, I muttered, yapping at my study-door,&mdash;</div>
<div class="i6">Only that, and nothing more.</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Ah, distinctly I remember it was early in November</div>
<div class="i1">When to town the wearied Member came, and thought the thing a bore.</div>
<div class="i1">Eagerly I hoped the morrow <span class="sc">Salisbury</span> some sense might borrow,</div>
<div class="i1">And I thought with ceaseless sorrow of the streamside and the moor,</div>
<div class="i1">Of the rare and radiant raptures of the streamside and the moor.</div>
<div class="i6">Heather’s sweep and trout-stream’s roar.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Open then I flung the doorway, when, with blast as chill as Norway,</div>
<div class="i1">In there stepped “Fair Trade” <span class="sc">Dunraven</span>, solemn as a monk of yore;</div>
<div class="i1">Not the least apology made he, though I thought his manners “shady,”</div>
<div class="i1">But, as stiff as <span class="sc">Tate</span> and <span class="sc">Brady</span>, stood within my study-door,</div>
<div class="i1">Underneath a bust of <span class="sc">Cobden</span> just above my study-door,&mdash;</div>
<div class="i6">Stood, and scowled, and nothing more.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Then this sombre guest, beguiling my tired spirit into smiling</div>
<div class="i1">By the <em>doctrinaire</em> decorum of the countenance he wore,</div>
<div class="i1">“Smugly trimmed and deftly shaven, though I trust I’m not a craven,</div>
<div class="i1">You have startled me, <span class="sc">Dunraven</span>,” said I, “yapping at my door.</div>
<div class="i1">Tell me what your little game is, late at night at this my door?”</div>
<div class="i6">Quoth <span class="sc">Dunraven</span>, “Tax once more!”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Much I chuckled (though urbanely) him to hear talk so insanely,</div>
<div class="i1">For his answer little wisdom, little relevancy bore;</div>
<div class="i1">And one cannot help agreeing no sane living human being</div>
<div class="i1">In “Fair Trade” salvation seeing, could come yapping at one’s door,</div>
<div class="i1">Snapping, late at night in winter, at a fellow’s study-door,</div>
<div class="i6">Just to bid him, “Tax once more!”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">But <span class="sc">Dunraven</span>, standing lonely under <span class="sc">Cobden’s</span> bust, spake only</div>
<div class="i1">Those same words as though his creed in those few words he did outpour.</div>
<div class="i1">Nothing further then he uttered; calm he looked, and quite unfluttered,</div>
<div class="i1">Then unto myself I muttered, “Other fads have flown before;</div>
<div class="i1">Very soon <em>this</em> fad will vanish, as Protection did before.”</div>
<div class="i6">Quoth <span class="sc">Dunraven</span>, “Tax once more!”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Startled at the silence broken by reply so patly spoken,</div>
<div class="i1">“Doubtless,” said I, “what he utters is his only stock and store,&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Caught from some bad fiscal master, whom trade-loss or farm-disaster</div>
<div class="i1">Followed fast and followed faster, till his talk one burden bore,&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Till the dirges of his craft one economic burden bore,&mdash;</div>
<div class="i6">Of ‘Tax&mdash;tax Corn once more!’</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“Prophet,” said I, “of things evil, Trade is going to the devil,</div>
<div class="i1">Is the plea of you and <span class="sc">Lowther</span>, <span class="sc">Chaplin</span>, many another bore.</div>
<div class="i1">Sophists dull, yet all undaunted, <em>do</em> you think the thing that’s wanted</div>
<div class="i1">By our land, depression-haunted,&mdash;tell me truly, I implore,&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Is it, <em>can</em> it be Protection? Answer plainly, I implore!”</div>
<div class="i6">Quoth <span class="sc">Dunraven</span>, “Tax once more!”</div>
<a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a><span class="pageno">58</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“Prophet,” said I, “of things evil, I <em>don’t</em> wish to be uncivil,</div>
<div class="i1">But, by heaven! this Fair Trade figment is becoming a big bore.</div>
<div class="i1">Think you Corn with taxes laden means an economic Aidenn</div>
<div class="i1">For that somewhat ancient maiden who ‘protected’ was of yore,</div>
<div class="i1">For that very ancient maiden, Agriculture?” With a roar</div>
<div class="i6">Yelled <span class="sc">Dunraven</span> “Tax once more!”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“Then it’s time that we were parting, Parroteer!” I cried, upstarting,</div>
<div class="i1">“Get thee back to silly Sheffield, twaddle on St. Stephen’s floor,</div>
<div class="i1"><em>I</em> require no further token of the rot your League hath spoken,</div>
<div class="i1">Fair Trade phalanx to be broken by experience sad and sore.</div>
<div class="i1">Take thy <span class="sc">Beakey’s</span> words to heart, who said Protection’s day was o’er!”</div>
<div class="i6">Quoth <span class="sc">Dunraven</span>, “Tax once more!”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And <span class="sc">Dunraven</span>, dolefuller waxing, still stands croaking of Corn-taxing,</div>
<div class="i1">Underneath the bust of <span class="sc">Cobden</span>, just above my study-door,</div>
<div class="i1">And his talk has all the seeming of a monomaniac’s dreaming&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Here I woke, and day was streaming through the lattice on the floor,</div>
<div class="i1">And I hope that no such vision e’er again my ears will bore</div>
<div class="i6">With the burden “Tax once more!”</div>

<div class="poemtitle"><span class="sc">The Ravenous Bull and the Bicycle.</span><br />(<i>With Apologies.</i>)</div>
<div class="i1">My name is William Rory, and I’m going to tell a story,</div>
<div class="i1">Tell the story of an accident I’ve never told before.</div>
<div class="i1">How when coming home from Dover I felt myself in clover,</div>
<div class="i1">And I will say, moreover, that my feet were rather sore;</div>
<div class="i1">The landlord said, “You’ll rue it,”</div>
<div class="i1">But I said, “I mean to do it.” But I’ll do it nevermore.</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And right well do I remember, ’twas early in September,</div>
<div class="i1">When that landlord said, “I’d rue it,” as he stood against the door,</div>
<div class="i1">When my feet were sore with walking for that day I had been stalking</div>
<div class="i1">Up and down the streets of Dover, where I’d never been before,</div>
<div class="i1">And I squinted at that landlord, and his warning did ignore.</div>
<div class="i1">But I’ll do it nevermore.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">So says I, “You’re only joking, and at me it’s fun you’re poking.”</div>
<div class="i1">But the landlord looked quite solemn, and spat upon the floor.</div>
<div class="i1">And says he, “You must be silly to attempt a road so hilly.</div>
<div class="i1">And see the time for starting, why it’s just now striking four!</div>
<div class="i1">Pray, sir, now do not do it, but stay over, I implore.”</div>
<div class="i1">This he oft had said before.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">But then he looked more willing, as I threw to him a shilling</div>
<div class="i1">To drink my health in whisky, as oft I’d done before.</div>
<div class="i1">And then I took my spanner, and all the bolts did hammer,</div>
<div class="i1">And tightened up the nuts, an operation I abhor,</div>
<div class="i1">Then I jumped into my saddle, shouting to him “<em>au revoir</em>.”</div>
<div class="i1">Only this, and nothing more.</div>

</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And as I felt aweary, the road to me seemed dreary</div>
<div class="i1">Drearier than ever it had seemed to me before,</div>
<div class="i1">But I was weary’s master, and round the wheel went faster,</div>
<div class="i1">And like a wingèd demon, along the road I tore,</div>
<div class="i1">In an hour and three-quarters I had done of miles a score.</div>
<div class="i1">This I’d done, and nothing more.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And every minute faster, dreaming of no disaster,</div>
<div class="i1">Along the road, ’mid dust and stones, my bike her master bore.</div>
<div class="i1">While I my way was winging, I betook myself to singing,</div>
<div class="i1">When all my nerves were palsied by a distant sullen roar;</div>
<div class="i1">And that roaring stopped my singing, and thinks I it is a boar.</div>
<div class="i1">This I thought, and something more.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Just then a corner turning, my blood went through me burning,</div>
<div class="i1">For there in front, with fiery eyes, a bull straight for me tore.</div>
<div class="i1">A moment he stood eyeing, then bike and me sent flying,</div>
<div class="i1">The perspiration trickled down my skin from every pore,</div>
<div class="i1">And I rather think that in my flight I must have somehow swore.</div>
<div class="i1">Merely swore, and nothing more.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">After such a fearful riot, I laid there on the quiet,</div>
<div class="i1">For he treated me so lively, and I wished the joke was o’er.</div>
<div class="i1">He had pitched me in a gutter, and my nerves were in a flutter,</div>
<div class="i1">And into a thousand pieces my new uniform he tore,</div>
<div class="i1">And says I he must be waiting for a taste of human gore.</div>
<div class="i1">This I said, and nothing more.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">While in the gutter lying, I saw that bull go flying</div>
<div class="i1">Along the road, at such a speed he’d never gone before.</div>
<div class="i1">So I let him go and curs’d him, and prayed the fates might burst him,</div>
<div class="i1">For my bicycle he’d humbugged, and he’d made me “awful” sore,</div>
<div class="i1">And I felt he’d quite undone me, but he’d never do so more.</div>
<div class="i1">And I muttered nevermore.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">I collected up the ruins of that nasty mad bull’s doin’s,</div>
<div class="i1">And straightway did I take them unto my cottage-door.</div>
<div class="i1">And my wife, when she espied me, said I wasn’t looking tidy.</div>
<div class="i1">And I told the awful story to the wife whom I adore,</div>
<div class="i1">And she said, “My dear, stop riding; do give up for evermore.”</div>
<div class="i1">And I have, for evermore.</div>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">A Cat-as-Trophy.</span></p>

<p>The other night as I lay musing, and my weary brain
confusing o’er the topics of the day, suddenly I heard the
rattling, as of serious hosts a-battling, as they mingled in the
fray. “What’s that?” I cried, upstarting, and into the
darkness darting, slap! I ran against the door. “Oh, ’tis
“naught,” young <em>Hornet</em> grumbled, as o’er a huge arm-chair,
I stumbled,” ’tis a flea, and nothing more.” “Then,” said
I, my anger rising, for I thought it so surprising that a flea
should thus offend, “do you think a small insect, sir, thus
would all the air infect, sir? No, ’tis not a flea, my friend.”</p>

<p>Now becoming sorely frightened, round my waist my
pants I tightened, and put on my coat and hat, and into the
darkness peering, I saw, with trembling and much fearing,
the glaring eyes of Thomas Cat, Esq.</p>

<p><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"></a><span class="pageno">59</span>
With astonishment and wonder I gazed upon this son of
thunder, as he sat upon the floor, when resolution taking, a
rapid movement making, lo! I opened wide the door.
“Now clear out,” I hoarsely shouted, as o’er my head my
boot I flouted; take your presence from my floor!” Then,
with air and mien majestic, this creature, called domestic,
made his exit through the door. Made his exit without
growling, neither was his voice heard howling, not a single
word he said.&mdash;And with feelings much elated, to escape a
doom so fated, I went back to my bed.</p>

<div class="poemtitle"><span class="sc">The End of</span> “<span class="sc">The Raven.</span>”</div>
<div class="i1">You’ll remember that a Raven in my study found a haven</div>
<div class="i1">On a plaster bust of Pallas, just above my chamber-door;</div>
<div class="i1">And that with no sign of flitting, he persisted there in sitting</div>
<div class="i1">Till, I’m not above admitting, that I found that bird a bore.</div>
<div class="i1">Found him, as he sat and watched me, an indubitable bore,</div>
<div class="i6">With his dreary “Never more.”</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">But it was, in fact, my liver caused me so to shake and shiver,</div>
<div class="i1">And to think a common Raven supernatural influence bore;</div>
<div class="i1">I in truth had, after dining, been engaged some hours in “wining”&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">To a grand old port inclining&mdash;which its date was ’44!</div>
<div class="i1">And it was this crusted vintage, of the season ’44,</div>
<div class="i6">Which had muddled me so sore.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">But next morn my “Eno” taking, for my head was sadly aching,</div>
<div class="i1">I descended to my study, and a wicker cage I bore.</div>
<div class="i1">There the Raven sat undaunted, but I now was disenchanted,</div>
<div class="i1">And the sable fowl I taunted as I “H-s-s-h-d!” him from my door,</div>
<div class="i1">As I took up books and shied them till he flew from off my door,</div>
<div class="i6">Hoarsely croaking, “Never more!”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“Now, you stupid bird!” I muttered, as about the floor it fluttered.</div>
<div class="i1">“Now you’re sorry p’raps you came here from where’er you lived before?”</div>
<div class="i1">Scarcely had I time to ask it, when, upsetting first a casket,</div>
<div class="i1">My large-size waste-paper basket he attempted to explore,</div>
<div class="i1">Tore the papers with his beak, and tried its mysteries to explore,</div>
<div class="i6">Whilst I ope’d the cage’s door.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Ever in my actions quicker, I brought up the cage of wicker,</div>
<div class="i1">Placed it on the paper basket, and gave one loud “H-s-s-h!” once more.</div>
<div class="i1">When, with quite a storm of croaking, as though Dis himself invoking,</div>
<div class="i1">And apparently half choking, in it rushed old “Never more!”&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Right into the cage of wicker quickly popped old “Never more!”</div>
<div class="i6">And I smartly shut the door.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Then without the least compunction, booking to St. John’s Wood Junction,</div>
<div class="i1">To the “Zoo” my cage of wicker and its sable bird I bore.</div>
<div class="i1">Saw the excellent Curator, showed him the persistent prater&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Now in manner much sedater&mdash;and said, “Take him, I implore!</div>
<div class="i1">He’s a nuisance in my study, take him, Bartlett, I implore!”</div>
<div class="i6">And he answered, “Hand him o’er.”</div>

</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“Be those words our sign of parting!” cried I, suddenly upstarting,</div>
<div class="i1">“Get you in amongst your kindred, where you doubtless were before.</div>
<div class="i1">You last night, I own, alarmed me (perhaps the cucumber had harmed me!),</div>
<div class="i1">And you for the moment charmed me with your ceaseless ‘Never more!’&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Gave me quite a turn by croaking out your hollow ‘Never more!’</div>
<div class="i6">But ‘Good-bye!’ all that is o’er!”</div>
<div class="tb">*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*</div>
<div class="i1">Last Bank Holiday, whilst walking at the Zoo, and idly talking,</div>
<div class="i1">Suddenly I heard low accents that recalled the days of yore;</div>
<div class="i1">And up to the cages nearing, and upon the perches peering&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">There, with steak his beak besmearing, draggle-tailed, sat “Never more!”</div>
<div class="i1">Mutual was our recognition, and, in his debased condition, he too thought of heretofore;</div>
<div class="i1">For anon he hoarsely muttered, shook his draggled tail and</div>
<div class="i1">fluttered, drew a cork at me and swore&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Yes, distinctly drew three corks, and most indubitably swore!</div>
<div class="i6">Only that, and nothing more!</div>

<p>In many instances, authors have selected the
curious metre of “The Raven,” with its double
echoes, and sonorous refrain, for imitation in
poems of too serious a character to be styled
Parodies. One clever poem of this description
appeared a few years ago in “Lloyd’s Poetical
Magazine,” and has recently been republished
by its author, Mr. Ernest S. T. Harris-Bickford,
of Camborne. It is entitled, “A Vigil Vision,”
and is a very musical though rather sad poem,
in form and versification much resembling
“The Raven,” but having no refrain.</p>

<p>Any extracts would do it injustice, and it is
too long to quote in full; moreover, it scarcely
comes within the compass of this collection.</p>

<p><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"></a><span class="pageno">61</span>
Before quitting “The Raven” and the parodies
it has given rise to, it must be mentioned that
Mr. J. H. Ingram has clearly pointed out that it
was not in itself a perfectly original poem.
Indeed Poe, himself, in his half-serious, half-jesting
“Philosophy of Composition” remarks,
“Of course, I pretend to no originality in either
the rhythm, or the metre of “The Raven;”
adding, however, that nothing approaching the
peculiar combination of the verses into stanzas
had ever been previously attempted.</p>

<p>The first printed version of “The Raven”
appeared in the <cite>Evening Mirror</cite> (New York) on
the 29th of January, 1845; in 1843 Poe had been
writing for the <cite>New Mirror</cite>, another New York
paper, which in the number for Saturday,
October 14th, 1843, contained a poem in twelve
stanzas, entitled <cite>Isadore</cite>. This poem was written
by Mr. Albert Pike, a well-known American
<i>littérateur</i>, and was prefaced by an editorial
note, stating that the poem was one of the
imagination only, as the Poet’s wife was then
alive and perfectly well.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="poemtitle"><span class="sc">Isadore.</span></div>
<div class="i1">“Thou art lost to me for ever, I have lost thee, Isadore,&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Thy head will never rest upon my loyal bosom more.</div>
<div class="i1">Thy tender eyes will never more gaze fondly into mine,</div>
<div class="i1">Nor thine arms around me lovingly and trustingly entwine:</div>
<div class="i6">Thou art lost to me for ever, Isadore!”</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“My footsteps through the rooms resound all sadly and forlore;</div>
<div class="i1">The garish sun shines flauntingly upon the unswept floor;</div>
<div class="i1">The mocking-bird still sits and sings a melancholy strain,</div>
<div class="i1">For my heart is like a heavy cloud that overflows with rain.</div>
<div class="i6">Thou art lost to me for ever, Isadore.”</div>
<div class="tb">*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*</div>
<div class="i1">“Thou art gone from me for ever, I have lost thee, Isadore!</div>
<div class="i1">And desolate and lonely shall I be for evermore.</div>
<div class="i1">If it were not for our children’s sake, I would not wish to stay,</div>
<div class="i1">But would pray to God most earnestly to let me pass away,&mdash;</div>
<div class="i6">And be joined to thee in Heaven, Isadore.”</div>
</div><!--end stanza-->
</div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end container-->

<p>In “Isadore” the most distinctive&mdash;the only
salient&mdash;feature is the refrain with which each
stanza concludes; the metre and rhythm are
much less dexterously managed than in “The
Raven,” but it was evidently the author’s intention
to produce an effect similar to that which
Poe, with superior skill, did subsequently create.</p>

<div class="i1">It was many and many a year ago,</div>
<div class="i2">By a theatre known as P.</div>
<div class="i1">That a little boy stood, whom now we know</div>
<div class="i2">By the name of Wilson B.</div>
<div class="i1">Whose soul was filled with no other thought</div>
<div class="i2">Than to act the Prince of D.</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">He <em>was</em> a boy, and still like a boy,</div>
<div class="i2">In that theatre known as P.,</div>
<div class="i1">He plays in a play, that is not mere play,</div>
<div class="i2">And as Hamlet Prince of D.,</div>
<div class="i1">With many a clutch at his manly breast,</div>
<div class="i2">And a smile that is sweet to see.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">For this is the reason some time ago,</div>
<div class="i2">At his theatre known as P.,</div>
<div class="i1">In “Lights of London” and “Romany Rye,”</div>
<div class="i2">And the “Silver King” did he</div>
<div class="i1">Lead up to the higher “Claudian” rôle</div>
<div class="i2">Of poetic tragedee,</div>
<div class="i1">Till he’d raised the taste of that theatre</div>
<div class="i2">To Hamlet, Prince of D.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">For Irving, o’er sated with London’s praise</div>
<div class="i2">Went once more across the sea.</div>
<div class="i1">Yes! that was the reason, as all men know,</div>
<div class="i2">And not the mere L. S. D.</div>
<div class="i1">That the Lyceum company, touring, had left</div>
<div class="i2">The coast clear for Wilson B.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">But his rôle was more youthful by far than the rôle</div>
<div class="i2">Of actors more thrilling than he</div>
<div class="i2">Of parties intenser than he;</div>
<div class="i1">And neither the posing, nor withering smile,</div>
<div class="i2">Of a smothered agonee,</div>
<div class="i1">Can ever confuse his rôle with the rôle</div>
<div class="i2">Of the actor now over the sea.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">The play never plays, without crowding the ways</div>
<div class="i2">To that theatre we’ve named P.</div>
<div class="i1">And the lamps are not lit, ’ere the crowd at the pit</div>
<div class="i2">Are waiting for Wilson B.</div>
<div class="i1">And all the night long he is there with his stride</div>
<div class="i1">Of his youth, his beauty, in lime-light’s pride</div>
<div class="i2">In the theatre there you still may see</div>
<div class="i1">Beautiful B. as Prince of D.</div>

<div class="i1">And busted herself on a cruel rock;</div>
<div class="i2">A solemn sight to see,</div>
<div class="i1">For it spoiled the hat and gown and looks</div>
<div class="i2">Of the beautiful Annabel Lee.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">We loved with a love that was lovely love,</div>
<div class="i2">I and my Annabel Lee,</div>
<div class="i1">And we went one day to gather the nuts</div>
<div class="i2">That men call hickoree&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">And I stayed below in the rosy glow</div>
<div class="i2">While she shinned up the tree.</div>
<div class="i1">But no sooner up than down kerslup</div>
<div class="i2">Came the beautiful Annabel Lee.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And the pallid moon and the hectic noon</div>
<div class="i2">Bring gleams of dreams for me,</div>
<div class="i1">Of the desolate and the desperate fate</div>
<div class="i2">Of the beautiful Annabel Lee.</div>
<div class="i1">And I often think as I sink on the brink</div>
<div class="i1">Of slumber’s sea, of the warm pink link</div>
<div class="i2">That bound my soul to Annabel Lee;</div>
<div class="i1">And it wasn’t just best for her interest</div>
<div class="i2">To climb that hickory tree.</div>
<div class="i1">For had she stayed below with me,</div>
<div class="i1">We’d had no hickory nuts, may be,</div>
<div class="i1">But I would have had my Annabel Lee.</div>

<div class="i2">An arrow&mdash;the arrow of Love.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">With the pain King Phœbus was sobbing,</div>

 <p>This poem was published in 1844, and it has been suggested
that it was probably founded on the melancholy fate of Lady
Flora Hastings. This lady, who was attached to the Royal
Household, became the victim of rumours affecting her reputation,
and was very severely treated by the Queen and the
Duchess of Kent. Although the innocence of Lady Flora was
subsequently clearly established, she was unable to survive the
disgrace and injustice inflicted on her, and died in July, 1839.
But <cite>Lenore</cite> although published in 1844 was merely a revision
of a poem which had appeared in an early volume of Poe’s
writings, before the Lady Flora Hastings scandal.</p>

“<span class="sc">The Raven.</span>”</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>On page 217 of the second volume of the life
of Edgar Allan Poe, Mr. J. H. Ingram quotes the
following extract from one of his letters:&mdash;“Have
you seen ‘The Moral for Authors’ a new Satire
by J. E. Tuel? Who, in the name of Heaven, <em>is</em>
J. E. Tuel? The book is miserably stupid! He
has a long parody of the ‘Raven’&mdash;in fact, nearly
the whole thing seems to be aimed at me. If you
have not seen it and wish to see it I will send it.”</p>

<p>Poe was well within the mark when he stigmatised
“The Moral for Authors” as a miserably
stupid production. It was published in 1849 by
Stringer and Townsend of New York, and consisted
of forty-eight pages of rhyme almost entirely destitute
of reason. On one page, it is true, the author
vainly attempts a feeble parody of Lord Macaulay’s
style, and there is, of course, the parody of the
“Raven.” As Poe, himself, has alluded to this,
students of his life and works may probably wish to
refer to it, which they would have great difficulty
in doing as copies of the pamphlet are now exceedingly
scarce. I therefore reprint the parody in full,
from a copy kindly lent me by Mr. J. H. Ingram.</p>

<span class="sc">A Christmas Nightmare</span>.</div>
<div class="i1">Once, it happened I’d been dining, on my couch I slept reclining,</div>
<div class="i1">And awoke with moonlight shining brightly on my bedroom floor;</div>
<div class="i1">It was in the bleak December, Christmas night as I remember,</div>
<div class="i1">But I had no dying ember, as Poe had; when near the door,</div>
<div class="i1">Like a gastronomic goblin just beside my chamber door,</div>
<div class="i6">Stood a bird,&mdash;and nothing more.</div>

<div class="i1">And I said, for I’m no craven, “Are you <span class="sc">Edgar’s</span> famous raven,</div>
<div class="i1">Seeking as with him a haven&mdash;were you mixed up with <span class="sc">Lenore</span>?”</div>
<div class="i1">Then the bird uprose and fluttered, and this sentence strange he uttered&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">“Hang <span class="sc">Lenore</span>,” he mildly muttered; “you have seen me once before,</div>

<div class="i1">’Tis a mem’ry of my dinner, which I ate at half-past four;</div>
<div class="i1">Goose well stuffed with sage and onions, which I ate at half-past four.”</div>

<p>“The Raven” has been repeatedly translated.
A Latin version, by Lewis Gidley, was published
in Exeter in 1863, and again in 1866 by Parker of
Oxford and London. There are several German
versions of it, also a French translation by William
Hughes. But perhaps the most famous of all is the
grand folio published in Paris in 1875, entitled “<span class="sc">Le
Corbeau</span>, traduction française de Stéphane Mallarmé,
avec Illustrations par Edouard Manet.” The
translation is literal, and naturally loses much of the
force and beauty of the original from the absence
of rhyme. It lacks also much of the weird suggestiveness
of “The Raven,” whilst the refrain
“Jamais-plus” is but a poor substitute for the
sonorous “Nevermore!” Manet, the late chief of
the Impressionist School of Painters, has here given
full vent to his powers, and his eccentricity. In
some of his illustrations the effects of light and
shade are marvellous, in others he has been less
successful, whilst in one or two instances the illustrations
appear absolutely meaningless.</p>

<p><cite>Notes and Queries</cite> recently quoted an anecdote
of a Raven which must have been an ancestor of
Poe’s sinister bird. It is taken from a rare little
<a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"></a><span class="pageno">73</span>
book, to which it gives the subject of 166 pages of
edifying preachment, and of course is firmly believed
in by the author. The following is the
title:<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="blockquote">“Vox Corvi; or the Voice of a Raven, that Thrice spoke
these words distinctly: Look into Colossians the 3rd and
15th. The Text it self looked into, and opened, in a Sermon,
Preached at Wigmore, in the County of Hereford, To which

<p>The details are thus circumstantially related:<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="blockquote">“On the <abbr title="third">3d.</abbr> of February, 1691, about Three in the
Afternoon, this Reverend Divine, a person of the venerable
Age of 80 years, and 40 of those a Laborious Teacher of
God’s Word, in the Parish of Wigmore, in the County of
Hereford, being in the Hall of his own house, being with
the Pious Matron, his Wife, some Neighbours and Relations,
together with two small Grand-Children of his, in all to the
number of Eight Persons; Thomas Kinnersley, one of the
said Grand-Children, of but Ten Years of Age, starting
up from the Fireside, went out of the Hall-Door, and sate
himself down upon a Block by a Wood-pile, before the Door,
employing himself in no other Childlike Exercise than cutting
of a Stick, when in less than half a quarter of an Hour, he
returned into the Hall in great amazement, his Countenance
pale, and affrighted, and said to his Grandfather and Grandmother,
<span class="sc">Look in the Third of the Colossians, and
the Fifteenth</span>, with infinite Passion and Earnestness,
repeating the words no less than three Times, which Deportment
and Speech much surprising the whole Company, they
asked him what he meant by those words, who answered
with great Ardency of Spirit, that a <span class="sc">Raven</span> had spoken
them Three times from the Peak of the Steeple, and that it
looked towards W. W.’s House, and shook its <span class="sc">Head</span> and
<span class="sc">Wings</span> thitherwards, directing its Looks and Motions still

distinctly utter three times, and then saw it mount and fly
out of sight. His Grandfather hereupon, taking the Bible,
and turning to the said Text, found these words. ‘And let
the Peace of God rule in your Hearts, to the which you are
also called in one Body; and be ye thankful.’ Upon reading
whereof, the Child was fully satisfied, and his countenance
perfectly composed agen [<i>sic</i>].”</p>

<p class="center">POE-TICAL FORGERIES.</p>

<p>Whilst recently turning over some odd volumes
on a bookstall, in my never ending search for
<cite>Parodies</cite>, a loose newspaper cutting fell out of one
of them. It was headed “Edgar Allan Poe,” and
the obliging proprietor of the bookshop, where
this occurred, seeing the interest I took in the
subject, kindly gave me the slip, which I reprint
below. Although the letter is dated “August 31”
no year is given, nor was there anything on the

cutting to indicate from what paper it had been
taken. However, after considerable searching
amongst the newspaper files in the British Museum
I was enabled to trace it to <cite>The Morning Star</cite>
(London) of September 1, 1864.</p>

<p class="center small"><span class="sc">Edgar Allan Poe.</span></p>

<p class="blockquote"><span class="sc">Sir</span>&mdash;I have noticed with interest and astonishment the
remarks made in different issues of your paper respecting
Edgar A. Poe’s “Raven,” and I think the following fantastic
poem (a copy of which I enclose), written by the poet
whilst experimenting towards the production of that wonderful
and beautiful piece of mechanism, may possibly interest
your numerous readers. “The Fire-Fiend” (the title of
the poem I enclose) Mr. Poe considered incomplete and
threw it aside in disgust. Some months afterwards, finding
it amongst his papers, he sent it in a letter to a friend,
labelled facetiously, “To be read by fire-light at midnight,
after thirty drops of laudanum.” I was intimately acquainted
with the mother-in-law of Poe, and have frequently conversed
with her respecting “The Raven,” and she assured
me that he had the idea in his mind for some years, and used
frequently to repeat verses of it to her and ask her opinion
of them, frequently making alterations and improvements,
according to the mood he chanced to be in at the time,
Mrs. Clemm, knowing the great study I had given to “The
Raven,” and the reputation I had gained by its recital
throughout America, took great interest in giving me all the
information in her power, and the life and writings of Edgar
A. Poe have been the topic of our conversation for hours.</p>

<span class="sc">A Nightmare.</span></div>
<div class="poemdivider"><abbr title="one">I.</abbr></div>
<div class="i1">In the deepest depth of midnight, while the sad solemn swell</div>
<div class="i1">Still was floating, faintly echoed from the Forest Chapel Bell&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Faintly, falteringly floating o’er the sable waves of air</div>
<div class="i1">That were through the Midnight rolling, chafed and billowy with the tolling&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">In my chamber I lay dreaming by the fire-light’s fitful gleaming,</div>
<div class="i1">And my dreams were dreams foreshadowed on a heart fore-doomed to Care!</div>
<div class="poemdivider"><abbr title="two">II.</abbr></div>
<div class="i1">At the last long lingering echo of the midnight’s mystic chime&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Lifting through the sable billows to the Thither Shore of time&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Leaving on the starless silence not a token nor a trace&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">In a quivering sigh departed; from my couch in fear I started:</div>
<div class="i1">Started to my feet in terror, for my Dream’s phantasmal error</div>
<div class="i1">Painted in the fitful fire a frightful, fiendish, flaming face!</div>
<div class="poemdivider"><abbr title="three">III.</abbr></div>
<div class="i1">On the red hearth’s reddest centre, from a blazing knot of oak,</div>
<div class="i1">Seemed to gibe and grin this Phantom when in terror I awoke,</div>
<div class="i1">And my slumberous eyelids straining as I staggered to the floor,</div>
<span class="pageno">74</span>
<div class="i1">Still in that dread Vision seeming, turned my eyes toward the gleaming</div>
<div class="i1">Hearth, and&mdash;there! oh, God! I saw it! and from out its flaming Jaw it</div>
<div class="i1">Spat a ceaseless, seething, hissing, bubbling, gurgling stream of gore!</div>
<div class="poemdivider"><abbr title="four">IV.</abbr></div>
<div class="i1">Speechless; struck with stony silence; frozen to the floor I stood,</div>
<div class="i1">Till methought my brain was hissing with that hissing, bubbling, blood:&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Till I felt my life-stream oozing, oozing from those lambent lips:&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Till the Demon seemed to name me; then a wondrous calm o’ercame me,</div>
<div class="i1">And my brow grew cold and dewy, with a death-damp stiff and gluey,</div>
<div class="i1">And I fell back on my pillow in apparent soul-eclipse!</div>
<div class="poemdivider"><abbr title="five">V.</abbr></div>
<div class="i1">Then, as in Death’s seeming shadow, in the icy Pall of Fear</div>
<div class="i1">I lay stricken, came a hoarse and hideous murmur to my ear:&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Came a murmur like the murmur of assassins in their sleep:&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Muttering, “Higher! Higher! Higher! I am Demon of the Fire!</div>
<div class="i1">I am Arch-Fiend of the Fire! and each blazing roof’s my pyre,</div>
<div class="i1">And my sweetest incense is the blood and tears my victims weep!”</div>
<div class="poemdivider"><abbr title="six">VI.</abbr></div>
<div class="i1">“How I revel on the Prairie! How I roar among the Pines!</div>
<div class="i1">How I laugh when from the village o’er the snow the red flame shines,</div>
<div class="i1">And I hear the shrieks of terror, with a Life in every breath!</div>
<div class="i1">How I scream with lambent laughter as I hurl each crackling rafter</div>
<div class="i1">Down the fell abyss of Fire, until higher! higher! higher!</div>
<div class="i1">Leap the High Priests of my Altar in their merry Dance of Death!”</div>
<div class="poemdivider"><abbr title="seven">VII.</abbr></div>
<div class="i1">“I am monarch of the Fire! I am Vassal-King of Death!</div>
<div class="i1">World-encircling, with the shadow of its Doom upon my breath!</div>
<div class="i1">With the symbol of Hereafter flaming from my fatal face!</div>
<div class="i1">I command the Eternal Fire! Higher! higher! higher! higher!</div>
<div class="i1">Leap my ministering Demons, like Phantasmagoric lemans</div>
<div class="i1">Hugging Universal Nature in their hideous embrace!”</div>
<div class="poemdivider"><abbr title="eight">VIII.</abbr></div>
<div class="i1">Then a sombre silence shut me in a solemn shrouded sleep,</div>
<div class="i1">And I slumbered like an infant in the “Cradle of the Deep,”</div>
<div class="i1">Till the Belfry in the Forest quivered with the matin stroke,</div>
<div class="i1">And the martins, from the edges of its lichen-lidden ledges,</div>
<div class="i1">Shimmered through the russet arches where the Light in torn files marches,</div>
<div class="i1">Like a routed army struggling through the serried ranks of oak.</div>
<div class="poemdivider"><abbr title="nine">IX.</abbr></div>
<div class="i1">Through my ivy fretted casement filtered in a tremulous note</div>
<div class="i1">From the tall and stately linden where a Robin swelled his throat:&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Querulous, quaker breasted Robin, calling quaintly for his mate!</div>
<div class="i1">Then I started up, unbidden, from my slumber nightmare ridden,</div>
<div class="i1">With the memory of that Dire Demon in my central Fire</div>
<div class="i1">On my eye’s interior mirror like the Shadow of a Fate!</div>
<div class="poemdivider"><abbr title="ten">X.</abbr></div>
<div class="i1">Ah! the fiendish Fire had smouldered to a white and formless heap,</div>
<div class="i1">And no knot of oak was flaming as it flamed upon my sleep;</div>
<div class="i1">But around its very centre, where the Demon Face had shone,</div>
<div class="i1">Forked shadows seemed to linger, pointing as with spectral finger</div>
<div class="i1">To a <span class="sc">Bible</span>, massive, golden, on a table carved and olden&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">And I bowed, and said, “All Power is of God, of God alone!”</div>

<p class="p2">On showing this poem to Mr. J. H. Ingram he
at once pronounced it a forgery, and from his
remarkable collection of books relating to E. A.
Poe he produced a small volume of 104 pages
clad in green and gold, entitled <cite>The Fire-Fiend and
other Poems</cite>, by Charles D. Gardette. Published
in New York by Messrs. Bunce and Hartington in
1866. The book contains “The Fire-Fiend” and
“Golgotha,” both written in imitation of E. A. Poe,
and some poems entitled “War Echoes” and
“Vagaries” of no particular interest. The account
given of the origin of the hoax perpetrated on the
public by the author of “The Fire-Fiend” is contained
in the</p>

<p class="center"><i>PRE-NOTE.</i></p>

<p class="blockquote">“A few&mdash;and but a few&mdash;words of explanation
seem appropriate here, with reference to the poem
which gives title to this volume.</p>

<p class="blockquote">The “<span class="sc">Fire-Fiend</span>” was written some six years
ago, in consequence of a literary discussion wherein
it was asserted, that the marked originality of style,
both as to conception and expression, in the poems
of the late <span class="sc">Edgar Allen</span> (<i>sic</i>) <span class="sc">Poe</span>, rendered a
successful imitation difficult even to impossibility.
The author was challenged to produce a poem, in
the manner of “<cite>The Raven</cite>,” which should be
accepted by the general critic as a genuine composition
of Mr. <span class="sc">Poe’s</span>, and the “<span class="sc">Fire-Fiend</span>” was
the result.</p>

<p class="blockquote">This poem was printed as “from an unpublished
<abbr title="Manuscript">MS.</abbr> of the late <span class="sc">Edgar A. Poe</span>,” and the hoax
proved sufficiently successful to deceive a number
of critics in this country, and also in England where
it was afterwards republished (by Mr. <span class="sc">Macready</span>,
the tragedian), in the <cite>London Star</cite>, as an undoubted
production of its <i>soi-disant</i> author.</p>

<p class="blockquote">The comments upon it by the various critics,
professional and others, who accepted it as Mr.
<span class="sc">Poe’s</span>, were too flattering to be quoted here, the
more especially since, had the poem appeared
simply as the composition of its real author, these
<a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"></a><span class="pageno">75</span>
gentlemen would probably have been slow to discover
in it the same merits. The true history of
the poem, and its actual authorship, being thus
succinctly given, there seems nothing further to be
said, than to remain, very respectfully, the Reader’s
humble servant,</p>

<p class="quotesig"><span class="sc">The Author</span>.”</p>

<p>The poem which follows “The Fire-Fiend” is
nearly as clever an imitation of Poe’s verbal eccentricities,
but is perhaps a trifle too ghastly to be
pleasant reading:<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="i3">Naught you’ll find in ancient story</div>
<div class="i4"> Like those shapely symmetries.</div>
<div class="i3">Solomon, in all his glory,</div>

<div class="i6">Nothing can compare with those</div>

<div class="i3">Oh! those hose, hose, hose, hose,</div>
<div class="i6">Hose, hose, hose&mdash;</div>
<div class="i3">Those softly rounded, garter-bounded hose.</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i3">There’s a charm about those hose&mdash;</div>

<div class="i3">And whene’er we chance to spy them,</div>

<div class="i3">Damsels dark and damsels fair,</div>

<div class="i3">But the people-ah! the people&mdash;</div>
<div class="i3">They that dwell up in the steeple,</div>

<div class="i3">Shapely hose, hose, hose&mdash;</div>
<div class="i3">White as winter’s snows,</div>
<div class="i1">Save the stripes, so richly tinted with the blushes of the rose,</div>

or heard that wonderful poem of Edgar Poe’s&mdash;‘The
Raven’&mdash;and probably most of those who have read it
know also of that very singular essay in which the poet
explains the manner in which the poem was composed.
He tells them how he came to make choice of the particular
metre, how the burden suggested itself to his mind, how
the last verse was written first and the others to lead
gradually up to it, with a variety of minute and particular
details, all tending to shew its originality. The whole of
this essay turns out to be as ingenious a fiction as any of
the ‘tales of mystery’ with which it is usually bound up.
Poe’s sole accomplishment was a minute and accurate
acquaintance with Oriental languages, and this he turned
to account by translating almost literally the poem of ‘The
Raven’ from the Persian. The translation is so minute
and accurate that even the cadences are preserved throughout,
while the curious repetition of rhymes by which it is
distinguished is equally characteristic of the work of the
Persian poet. As a singular specimen of a literary imposture
such a matter as this deserves notice. The discovery
is due to the well-known eastern traveller, Mr. Lang,
formerly of the Bombay service, and has since been
corroborated, I hear, by some of the most celebrated
Orientalists in England.”&mdash;<cite>The Daily Review</cite>, Edinburgh,
August 18, 1864.</p>

<p class="center">SPIRITUAL POEMS.</p>

<p>A very curious feature of the modern American
press has been the rapid growth of so-called Spiritual
literature. Those who are incredulous in regard to
these Spiritual manifestations simply assert that a
poetical medium is one, who not having sufficient
genius and originality to make a name and a place in
literature for himself, falls back on the trick of
imitating the style of some deceased popular author,
and proclaims his (often stupid) Parody the veritable
production of the spirit of the author imitated. Perhaps
it is owing to the known partiality entertained
by Edgar A. Poe for alcohol during his lifetime, or
it may be due to the ease with which his style of
versification may be imitated, that his spirit has
been so often invoked, and his name so frequently
used by the Spiritualists.</p>

<p>Without attempting to discuss the mode in which
these poems have been given to the world, it will be
quite sufficient to quote a few, and these of the
very best, to show that Poe’s Spirit has not produced
anything at all equal in quality to the poems written
by Poe whilst he was still in the flesh. Power,
freshness, and originality they seem to lack entirely,
but the quantity is superabundant; the chief difficulty
in making a selection that shall be at once
illustrative and interesting, is to avoid making it too
voluminous. Few, indeed, of these poems possess
the attributes of Poe’s style,&mdash;his luxurious reiteration
of thought in similar lines,&mdash;his musical
alliteration&mdash;his exquisite sense of rhyme. Here
and there occurs a slight assumption of the mystical,
but it is mere obscurity without suggestiveness.
It is asserted that most of these Spiritual Poems
were taken down from the lips of persons whilst in
a state of trance.</p>

<p>One of the earliest Spirit Poems was said to be
dictated through the medium of Mrs. <span class="sc">Lydia
Tenney</span>, of George Town, Mass., U.S.A., and was
triumphantly claimed as a proof that Poe’s Spirit
had written a poem. Mr. William Sawyer utterly
demolished this poem in an article in the <cite>Brighton
Herald</cite>, and as it does not possess any resemblance
to Poe’s style, it would be out of place here.</p>

<p>The first Spirit poem to be quoted is a sequel to
“The Raven,” by a certain <span class="sc">R. Allston Lavender</span>,
who asserted that it was dictated to him by the
spirit of E. A. Poe. When last heard of Mr.
Lavender was an inmate of a lunatic asylum in the
United States.</p>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="i4">Once before, I found a mortal</div>
<div class="i4">Waiting at the heavenly portal&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Waiting out to catch some echo from that ever-opening door;</div>

<div class="i4">Now I come more meekly human,</div>

<div class="i4">Where I drained the cup of sadness,</div>

<div class="i1">And life’s bitter, burning billows swept my burdened being o’er.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i4">Here the harpies and the ravens,</div>
<div class="i4">Human vampires, sordid cravens,</div>
<div class="i1">Preyed upon my soul and substance, till I writhed in anger sore;</div>
<div class="i4">Life and I then seemed mismated,</div>

<div class="i1">Like a restless, wrathful spirit, wandering the Stygian shore.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i4">Tortured by a nameless yearning,</div>
<div class="i4">Like a fire-frost, freezing, burning,</div>
<div class="i1">Did the purple, pulsing life-tide through its feeble channels pour;</div>
<div class="i4">Till the golden bowl, life’s token,</div>
<div class="i4">Into shining shards was broken,</div>
<div class="i1">And my chained and chafing spirit let from out its prison door.</div>

<div class="i4">Like a lone one, weak and weary,</div>
<div class="i4">Wandering in the mid-night dreary,</div>
<div class="i1">On her sinless, saintly bosom, brought me to the heavenly shore.</div>

<div class="i4">Like the prayers of saints ascending,</div>
<div class="i1">Like the rainbow’s seven-hued glory, blend on souls forevermore;</div>
<div class="i4">Earthly lust and lore enslaved me,</div>
<div class="i4">But divinest love hath saved me,</div>
<div class="i1">And I know now, first and only, how to live and how to adore.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i4">O, my mortal friends and brothers!</div>
<div class="i4">We are each and all another’s,</div>
<div class="i1">And the soul which gives most freely from its treasures hath the more.</div>
<div class="i4">Would you lose life, you must find it,</div>

<p>Another long poem, entitled “Farewell to
Earth,” was delivered by Miss <span class="sc">Lizzie Doten</span> at
the conclusion of a Lecture at Clinton Hall, New
York; it purported to be <span class="sc">E. A. Poe’s</span> final “Farewell
to this World.” It was printed in Number 2
of <cite>Inspirational Poems</cite>, and published by F. N.
Broderick, 1, St. Thomas’s Square, Ryde, Isle of
Wight, for the small price of one penny; alas! it
was dear at that. But the culmination of absurdity
is to be found in a book entitled <cite>Improvisations from
the Spirit</cite>, published in London in 1857. This
ridiculous work was the production of Dr. J. J.
Garth Wilkinson, a rather well known character
in St. John’s Wood about thirty years ago. If we
are to credit this author, the 400 closely printed
pages of this curious jumble of clerical cant terms,
spiritualism, and Swedenborgianism, were written
under a kind of inspiration. Since August 1857
the inspired volume had rested undisturbed on
the library shelves of the British Museum, nor had
any sacrilegious paperknife disturbed its uncut
edges until the Editor of <cite>Parodies</cite> assailed them.
And there he found an “Imitation of E. A. Poe,” a
mad kind of poem, a dribbling in rhyme, of which,
one verse will surely be sufficient for even the
most spiritualistic reader:<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="i1">And that his feet were gaining</div>
<div class="i2">Strange features from below;</div>
<div class="i1">And that his toes were raining</div>
<div class="i2">Toe-nails upon his brow:</div>
<div class="i1">And that his heart and liver</div>
<div class="i2">Were shuffling in their seats;</div>
<div class="i1">And that he heard them quiver</div>

<p>In the library of the British Museum there is a small octavo
pamphlet of 24 pages, entitled “Pot-Pourri.” It was apparently
printed for private circulation only. The author’s
name is not given, but it bears the imprint, “Entered,
according to Act of Congress, in the year 1875, by <span class="sc">Abel
Reid</span>, in the office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington.”
“<span class="sc">S. W. Green</span>, Printer and Electrotyper, 16 &amp; 18,
Jacob St., New York.” The eleven poems it contains are
all parodies of Poe’s writings, as the titles sufficiently indicate.
Indeed many of the lines are taken bodily, and without the
slightest acknowledgement, from Poe himself, whilst the
stanzas, entitled, “Part of an Unfinished Ghoul-Poem,” in
“Poetic Fragments,” were written by Poe, and intended by
him to form the conclusion of “Ulalume.” He had, however,
suppressed these lines at the request of Mrs. Whitman, the
lady to whom he was engaged to be married, when his career
was cut short by his miserable excesses. The author of
“Pot-Pourri,” though evidently an admirer of the genius of
Poe, utters a protest against the excessive hero-worship of
some American critics; but it is a pity that he was not himself
more candid and ingenuous in his treatment of the dead
poet’s works. The following is an exact reprint of this scarce
pamphlet; to facilitate comparison with the originals, a few
stanzas from Poe’s poems are quoted at the foot of several of
the parodies.</p>

<div class="i1">And Sarah would soon have been screaming&mdash;</div>
<div class="i2">She shook like a leaf with affright,</div>
<div class="i2">Like a leaf, or a bird in a fright;</div>
<div class="i1">So I lifted her out of the gleaming,</div>

<div class="i1">It was many and many a year ago&mdash;</div>
<div class="i2">It seems so long to me,</div>
<div class="i1">That there lived in a city which you may know</div>
<div class="i2">A man named Hannibal Leigh;</div>
<div class="i1">And this man he seem’d to have nothing to do</div>
<div class="i2">But to drink and get drunk with me.</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">I was a fool and he was a fool,</div>
<div class="i2">In this city by the sea</div>
<div class="i1">For we drank and got drunk till we made it a rule</div>
<div class="i2">That neither should drunker be;</div>
<div class="i1">And we drank till we might have lesson’d a school</div>
<div class="i2">Of fishes, such drinkers were we.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And this was the reason that long ago</div>
<div class="i2">In this city by the sea</div>
<div class="i1">A fusilier spirit of ill distilling</div>
<div class="i2">Destroy’d my Hannibal Leigh.</div>
<div class="i1">’Twas a spirit of ill when my pal was willing</div>
<div class="i2">To drink for ever with me;</div>
<div class="i1">And some were saying it was fulfilling</div>
<div class="i2">A kind o’ warning to me.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">The angels, not half so happy in heaven,</div>
<div class="i2">Went envying him and me&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Yes! that was the reason, whatever was given</div>
<div class="i2">In that city by the sea,</div>
<div class="i1">Why the fusilier spirit came out a-killing</div>
<div class="i2">My still-swilling Hannibal Leigh.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">But I drink all the longer and drink it more strong,</div>
<div class="i2">For the two, for I drink like three,&mdash;</div>
<div class="i2">For myself once and twice for Leigh;</div>
<div class="i1">And no fusil here nor in heaven along,</div>
<div class="i2">Nor spirit down under the sea,</div>
<div class="i1">Shall ever dissever our drinks to do wrong</div>
<div class="i2">To the spirit of Hannibal Leigh.</div>
<a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a><span class="pageno">102</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">For whenever I drink I endeavour to think,</div>
<div class="i2">I am drinking with Hannibal Leigh;</div>
<div class="i1">And my hand never raise but to drink to the praise</div>
<div class="i2">Of my drink-Kaiser Hannibal Leigh;</div>
<div class="i1">And in all the night tide I hold on to the side</div>
<div class="i2">Of the counter, the counter where Hannibal died;</div>
<div class="i1">And I think that I Hannibal see</div>
<div class="i2">And I’m Hannibal, Hannibal’s me.</div>

<div class="i2">Once upon a midnight, weary,</div>

<div class="i3">O’er an oft-repeated story,</div>
<div class="i1">Till my friends thought me a bore&mdash;</div>

<div class="i2">I forgot all I had read of,</div>

<div class="i1">The dead brain of one no more.</div>
<div class="i2">Would I trust their words instead of</div>

<div class="i2">I’m but overcome with thinking;</div>

<p>Many good and honest souls, neither prigs nor pedants,
are disposed to look with suspicion on the parody. They are
not incapable of appreciating its good points; they will even
allow it, when it is so, to be very good fun of its kind; but it
is the <em>kind</em> they cannot away with. Nor are they always of
that sort&mdash;a numerous and flourishing sort in our day&mdash;which,
being itself one monstrous parody, is naturally prone to look
with dislike on all who are blessed&mdash;or cursed, as some would
say&mdash;with a sense of the ridiculous. But they regard it as an
abuse of the gifts both of nature and of art; as apt to degrade
and vulgarize what should really elevate and refine; as itself
intrinsically an injustice; and, indeed, the more unjust as it is
the more skilful.</p>

<p>There is so much both of justice and reason in this dislike
that one cannot but respect it, though seeing how unreasonably
it may be pushed and how unjust it may become. It is
based, primarily, of course, upon sentiment&mdash;but it is a sentiment,
in its original shape, both honourable and true. The
word sentiment has come in these days to have a ridiculous
twang in our ears partly through the silly and perverted uses
to which the thing itself is too often applied, and partly
through a confusion between the two qualities, <em>sentiment</em> and
<em>sentimentality</em>, which may best be distinguished perhaps by defining
the latter as the abuse of the former. It is sentiment
which leads us to mark the houses where great men have been
born or lived; it is sentiment which leads us to gaze with
reverent admiration on that place of honour in the British
Museum wherein are enshrined the handwritings of so many
of our illustrious dead; all the care we take to preserve the
memorials of the past is inspired by sentiment. But it is a
sentiment which every right-thinking man would be far more
ashamed to miss than to share. It is a very different feeling,
for example, from that which induced a young lady on the
other side of the world to preserve under a glass case the
cherry-stones which she had snatched from the plate of a
Royal Duke; it is a very different feeling from that which induces
so many pious souls to play such fantastic tricks at the
knees of living men. This objection, then we are not disposed
in the first instance to quarrel with, especially as most
of the so-called parodies, burlesques, or “perversions” of to-day
are certainly bad enough to cover even a greater intolerance.
They are bad both in art and tactics. They deal too
often with subjects which should be kept free even from the
most good-natured ridicule, and they deal with them clumsily.
There is a sort of mind to whom every success, however lawfully
and honourably gained, is sufficient cause for mockery;
the higher a great figure towers above their heads the more
active are their monkeyish gambols at its feet. The living
and the dead are alike the objects of their impish regard, and
if they perhaps enjoy a livelier pleasure in the thought of the
irritation they can cause to the living, they seem to share a
peculiar satisfaction in showing themselves superior to any
feeling of reverence for the dead&mdash;to say nothing of the fact
that in the latter case the game is apt to be a little the safest.
The most part of mankind will sooner laugh at their more successful
fellows than try to imitate, or, at least, to respect
them; it is easy, then, to understand why the most witless
and illiberal parody will never want an audience.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the parody in itself is not only capable of
increasing the gaiety of nations by perfectly harmless and
legitimate means, but can also, when properly handled and
directed, be made to play the part of a chastener and instructor.
It has been often said that to parody a writer is
really to pay a compliment to his popularity; and this is so
far true that no one would think it worth his while to parody
any work which was not tolerably well known, for half the
point of any imitation must always lie in the readiness with
which its resemblance to the original is recognized; if the
<span class="pageno">104</span>
original be not known the imitation must necessarily fall flat.
No really good writer was ever injured by a parody; few, we
may suppose, have ever been annoyed by one. No one, for
example, was more quick to recognize the cleverness and
laugh at the fun of “A Tale of Drury Lane” in the <cite>Rejected
Addresses</cite> than Scott himself; Crabbe, though he thought
there was a little “undeserved ill-nature” in the prefatory
address owned that in the versification of “The Theatre”
he had been “done admirably.” On the other hand, we can
fancy that Messieurs Fitzgerald and Spencer saw very little
fun or wit, or anything but “undeserved ill-nature” in “The
Loyal Effusion” and “The Beautiful Incendiary.” The
paradoxical saying attributed to Shaftesbury, which so puzzled
and irritated Carlyle, that ridicule is the test of truth, finds
its true explanation in his real words, “A subject which will
not bear raillery is suspicious.” Nothing good was ever destroyed
by raillery; where it plays the part of iconoclast, the
images it breaks are the images of false gods. Nay, and even
to the true it may sometimes prove of service. It may gently
admonish, for instance, the best and most established writer,
when, from haste, from carelessness, from over-confidence, he
is in danger of forfeiting his reputation; it may gently lead
the tiro, while there is yet time, from the wrong into the
right path. Nor on writers only may it be exercised
with advantage. All men who have in any capacity become,
as it were, the property of the public may by its means
be warned that they are trespassing too far on their popularity,
that they are in danger of becoming not only ridiculous
themselves, but harmful to others; for every strong man
who presumes upon his strength is capable of becoming a
source of injury to his weaker brethren. We do not say that
its lessons are always, or even often, taken to heart; but
that does not detract from their possible virtue. If such a
plea were allowed, what, in the name of humanity, would become
of so many of us? What would become of our lawyers,
our statesmen, our philosophers, our doctors, our policemen,
our&mdash;appalling thought!&mdash;our critics, if the failure of their
endeavours to set and to keep their erring brethren in the
straight path were to be taken as a right reason for their abolition?
Their resistance to error may seem hopeless, may be
often ineffectual, but not for that should they abandon it;
rather should they cry, with the author of <cite>Obermann</cite>, “Let
us die resisting.”</p>

<p>But whatever may be the moral virtue of a parody,
there can be no question that to show any reason for its
existence at all it must be very good. There is nothing in
the world so pitiful as poor fun, and a bad parody is
perhaps the poorest kind of fun. In his review of the
famous <cite>Addresses</cite>, Jeffrey discussed the various sorts of
parody at some length, and with a good deal of acuteness,
distinguishing between the mere imitation of externals,
mere personal imitation, so to speak&mdash;and that higher and
rarer art which brings before us the intellectual characteristics
of the original. “A vulgar mimic,” he says, “repeats
a man’s cant phrases and known stories, with an
exact imitation of his voice, look, and gestures; but he is
an artist of a far higher description who can make stories
or reasonings in his manner, and represents the features
and movements of his mind as well as the accidents of his
body. It is a rare feat to be able to borrow the diction
and manner of a celebrated writer to express sentiments
like his own&mdash;to write as he would have written on the
subject proposed to his imitator&mdash;to think his thoughts,
in short, as well as to use his words&mdash;and to make the
revival of his style appear a natural consequence of the
strong conception of his peculiar ideas.” And he goes on,
“The exact imitation of a good thing, it must be admitted,
promises fair to be a pretty good thing in itself; but if the
resemblance be very striking, it commonly has the additional
advantage of letting us more completely into the
secret of the original author, and enabling us to understand

far more clearly in what the peculiarity of his manner
consists, than most of us would ever have done without
this assistance.” Jeffrey here carries the parody into
the regions of very high art indeed, if he does not, as we
are rather inclined to think he does, lay more upon its
shoulders than it can bear. In a note to the same review,
when reprinted in the collected edition of his essays, he
remarks of these <cite>Addresses</cite> that “some few of them descend
to the level of parodies, but by far the greater part are of
a much higher description;” from which it would seem
that he draws a distinction between a parody and something
“of a much higher description,” which we must confess
to being a little in the dark about, unless it be an imitation,
and that we should be disposed to rank very much
below a good parody. Many of our minor bards, for example,
have produced extraordinarily close imitations of
Mr. Swinburne’s style; but we should certainly rank
these far below a clever parody, such a one, for instance,
as that on <cite>Locksley Hall</cite> in the “Bon Gaultier Ballads,”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_18" id="fnanchor_18"></a><a href="#footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></span>
or as Mr. Calverley’s inimitable “The Cock and the Bull,”
or “Lovers,” and “A Reflection.” No better imitations,
both of style and substance, have ever been written in
prose than Thackeray’s “Codlingsby” and “George de
Barnwell;” but they are most unquestionably parodies.
Indeed it is hard to see what virtue there can be in an
imitation which is not also a parody&mdash;that is, as we take
it, a consciously exaggerated imitation; an imitation
which is not that, surely, instead of, as Jeffrey says, descending
to the level of a parody, goes near to descend to
the much lower level of a plagiarism.</p>

<p>If we wished to distinguish between the parody designed
to ridicule and that designed only to amuse, we should be
inclined to say that, while the latter contents itself with
an imitation of the style, the former aims also at an imitation
of the thought and substance. In the parodies
we have noticed, for example, Thackeray unquestionably
intended to ridicule the authors of <cite>Eugene Aram</cite> and
<cite>Coningsby</cite>. Both their subjects and the manner of handling
those subjects seemed to him such as deserved ridicule
and he ridiculed them accordingly, as no one but
Thackeray could. On the other hand, we do not for a
moment suppose that the clever Oxford parodist who
sang the labours and ultimate triumph of “Adolphus
Smalls of Boniface” intended to ridicule Macaulay. He
took <cite>The Lays of Ancient Rome</cite> as his model, because they
were more familiar probably to his readers than any
other form of verse, and because their external characteristics
were most easy to reproduce. We read such
lines as<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="unindent">we entirely acquit the writer of any design to laugh at Mr.
Bret Harte. In both these cases the parodies are really no
more than proofs of the universal popularity of the writers
parodied. But when we read in <cite>Rejected Addresses</cite> the parodies
on Wordsworth and Coleridge, we feel that the writers
were intentionally casting ridicule on certain trivialities, certain
commonplaces both of diction and thought, to which
these great men did occasionally sink.</p>

 <p> It seems to us, also, that Jeffrey has rated the virtue of
<em>sound</em> in a parody too low&mdash;which is, perhaps, only to say
that he rates the whole art of parody higher than we do.
Surely it is an essential of this sort of imitation that the
words should strike the ear with the very echo of the original.
For this reason the specimens we have quoted seem
to us so particularly good; and for the same reason, with
the exception of the “Lay of the Lovelorn,” the clever ballads
of Bon Gaultier do not seem to us to really come under
the definition of parodies at all. And it is this quality which
gives the point to Mr. Bromley Davenport’s “Lowesby
Hall.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_20" id="fnanchor_20"></a><a href="#footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></span> In such lines as these&mdash;though, indeed, the whole

<p>We are very far from saying that parody is a matter of
sound only; to borrow a well-known line,</p>

<p class="center">The sound must seem an echo to the sense.</p>

<p class="unindent">But certainly it strikes us as being a very important point,
and we doubt whether any really clever parody ever was
written, or ever will be, in which it does not play a conspicuous
part, if not the most conspicuous. And this,
perhaps, is the reason why those greatest works of poetry,
where the style strikes one as the natural and inevitable
vehicle of the thought, are really above the reach of parody;
why all attempts to parody them, however clever, lose their
cleverness in the larger consciousness of bad taste. But to
place all parodies under this ban is surely unreasonable. It
is unreasonable, as depriving the world of a great deal of
harmless amusement, and also, as we have said, of a method,
often more truly efficacious than more serious castigation, of
exposing incompetence and affectation.</p>

<p><cite>The Athenæum</cite> of May 12, 1866, contained a
note speaking favorably of the general tone of the
poem “My Mother,” but stating that it was spoilt
by the last verse, in which the only reason given
why a child should not despise its mother is <em>the</em>

<em>fear of God’s vengeance</em>. The writer proposed that
Mr. Tennyson should be asked to compose a final
verse more in accordance with the sentiments contained
in the preceding lines.</p>

<p>In the following number of <cite>The Athenæum</cite> (May
19, 1866), appeared a reply from the authoress
of “My Mother,” then a very old lady:<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="blockquote">“Allow me to thank your Correspondent of last
Saturday for both his praise and blame; I am grateful for
one and confess to the other, in his notice of a little poem&mdash;‘My Mother,’
of which I was the author, it may be
something more than sixty years ago. I see now, so much
as he does, though <em>not in all its implications</em>, that, should
another edition pass through the press, I will take care
that the offending verse shall be omitted; or, as I may
hope (without troubling the Laureate), replaced. I have
regarded our good old theologian, Dr. Watts, as nearly
our only predecessor in verses for children; and his name&mdash;a
name I revere&mdash;I may perhaps plead in part, though
not so far as to accept now, what did not strike me as
objectionable then. There has been an illustrated edition
of our ‘Original Poems’ recently published by Mr. Virtue,
and I am sorry to see it retained there; but, as still the
living author, I have sufficient right to expunge it.</p>

Jane Taylor, of whom <em>I</em> am the <em>Ann</em>; and remain,

<p>This suggested alteration, does not, however,
remove the objectionable word “despise,” which
is utterly absurd as applied to such a mother as
the poem describes.</p>

<p>It may be added that the original last verse is
still very generally printed with the poem.</p>

<p>The history of the poem was thus given in that
valuable storehouse of literary facts, “Notes and
Queries,” in August 30, 1884.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“In 1798, Ann Taylor, then residing with her family in
Colchester, aged about sixteen, made a purchase of <cite>A
Minor’s Pocket-Book</cite>, a periodical published by Harvey
and Darton, 55, Gracechurch Street, London. This contained
enigmas, and the solutions of previous ones, and
poetical pieces to which prizes were adjudged. Fired with
enthusiasm, she set to work, and unravelled enigma,
charade, and rebus, and forwarded the results under the
signature of ‘Juvenilia.’ They were successful, and
obtained the first prize&mdash;six pocket-books. She continued
<a name="Page_107" id="Page_107"></a><span class="pageno">107</span>
her contributions for some years, at first anonymously,
assisted by her younger sister Jane, and subsequently she
became the editor during twelve or fourteen years, up to
the time of her marriage in 1813.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“On July 1, 1803, Darton and Harvey wrote requesting
some specimens of easy poetry for young children. The
letter proceeds: ‘If something in the way of moral songs
(though not songs) or short tales turned into verse, or&mdash;but
I need not dictate. What would be most likely to
please little minds must be well known to every one of
those who have written such pieces as we have already
seen from thy family,’ &amp;c. Their father (Isaac Taylor,
afterwards of Ongar) did not quite approve of the proceeding,
remarking, ‘I do not want my girls to become
authors.’</p>

<p class="blockquote">“The commission was undertaken by the two sisters,
and, at the end of 1803, a small volume appeared, with
the title, <cite>Original Poems for Infant Minds</cite>, by several Young
Persons. The work did not consist exclusively of the
Taylor contributions. Ann remarks, ‘Having written to
order, we had no control over the getting out of the
volumes, and should have been better pleased if contributions
from other hands had been omitted.’ The sisters
received five pounds for the first volume, which succeeded
so well that a commission was given in November, 1804,
for a second volume, for which they were paid another five
pounds. It is in the first volume that ‘My Mother,’
entirely written by Ann, appears.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Jane Taylor continued to devote herself to literature
until her decease, in April, 1824, at the age of forty-one.
Ann married the Rev. Joseph Gilbert, in December, 1813,
and withdrew from literary work for the rest of her life,
except very occasionally. This is much to be regretted,
as she possessed rare talents; many of the most popular
poems usually ascribed to Jane having been really written
by Ann. Mrs. Gilbert survived to a happy and honoured
old age, and died <abbr title="December">Dec.</abbr> 20, 1866, within a month of the
completion of her eighty-fifth year.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Only a fortnight before her death she wrote, ‘You
remember that in May last there was a discussion in the
<cite>Athenæum</cite> on my poem, ‘My Mother,’ which surprised
everybody as an announcement and advertisement of my
continued existence, so that the Post Office has gained all
but a revenue from letters addressed to me, which, kindly
complimentary as they are, I have, of course, had to
answer.’</p>

<p class="blockquote">“The above brief notices of an estimable member of a
talented family may not be without interest in connexion
with the poem to which allusion has been made.</p>

<p class="blockquote"><span class="left">“Sandyknowe, Wavertree.</span> <span class="right sc">J. A. Picton.”</span></p>

<p>A further account of Miss Ann Taylor and her
family will be found in “The Family Pen,” by
Isaac Taylor, which contains memorials, biographical
and literary, of the Taylor family, of Ongar.
The work was published in two volumes in 1867.
The poem “My Mother,” has recently been
translated into German by Carmen Sylva, Queen
of Roumania. Before quoting any parodies of this
poem it may be as well to insert the well-known
lines “To Mary,” written by the poet Cowper
ten years before the publication of Miss Taylor’s
“My Mother.” The similarity of the two poems
can scarcely have been accidental, and authors of
parodies of the one, often approach near to an
imitation of the other.</p>

<p>A “Sister” writes from Newcastle-upon-Tyne:&mdash;“Dear
Mr. Editor,&mdash;In the March part of ‘B. O. P.’ occur two
poems, ostensibly Dick’s and Tom’s Letter to yourself,
anent the miseries which Tom inflicts upon Dick, and <em>vice
versa</em>. Now, on perusal of the said poems, my small brother
Harry discovered that some features of (to <em>him</em>, at least)
absorbing interest had been omitted in their construction.
‘But <em>that</em> fellow hasn’t got red hair,’ he exclaimed, indignantly,
‘or else <em>his</em> brother would have bullied him about
that, too.’ ‘Then since <em>you</em> have,’ I mildly ventured, to
hint, ’suppose you write a description of your woes, and
we’ll send it to the Editor. While <em>I</em> will have <em>my</em> say about
‘brothers,’ for really I don’t see why girls shouldn’t have a
voice in the matter, seeing that they often have not only to
mend, at unreasonable times, the said brothers’ wearing apparel,
but also to bear at all seasons with their growlings.’</p>

<p>“So, Mr. Editor, Harry and I send you our humble offerings,

<p>From <cite>Horace in London</cite>, by James and Horace Smith,
authors of “Rejected Addresses,” 1815. William Godwin,
the author of a Life of Chaucer; “Fleetwood;” “Caleb
Williams,” “St. Leon,” and other works, was a well
known character in the literary world in the beginning
of the present century. He married Mary Wollstonecraft,
and their daughter, the authoress of <cite>Frankenstein</cite>, became
the wife of Shelley the poet. William Godwin died in
1836, aged 81. There is a short sketch of his career in
“The Maclise Portrait Gallery.”</p>

<p>(In 1826 Don Pedro, King of Portugal, abdicated the
throne in favour of his daughter, Maria <abbr title="two">II.</abbr>, but his brother
Don Miguel, usurped the crown, which he retained until
1833, amidst almost incessant civil war, and commotion.
His character was detestable, and his reign cruel and
tyrannical, yet Henry Phillpotts, the grasping and intolerant
Bishop of Exeter, gave him his sympathy.
Thomas Moore, in this parody, refers to the Bishop’s
greed (at one time he held no less than five rich livings,
and two prebendal stalls), and to the part he took in defence
of the detestable Peterloo massacre of innocent
people assembled at a public meeting. Fortunately for
Portugal there were few Englishmen who followed Phillpotts
in befriending Don Miguel, and the news of his
downfall, in 1833, and the proclamation of Queen Maria,
were loudly welcomed in England. Miguel had visited
London in 1827; he died in exile in November, 1866.)</p>

<p>Frederick William, King of Prussia, (the elder brother of
the present German Emperor,) had the credit of being a
stupid sensualist, and was long known in England by the
nickname “King Clicquot.” During his reign Prussia had
come to occupy a lower position in Europe than she had ever
before held during her existence as a Kingdom. It seemed
almost marvellous how by any process the country of the
Great Frederick could have sunk to such a condition of insignificance.
At the period just preceding the Crimean War
the King of Prussia, with his usual indecision of character,
led the Allies to believe he would side with them, and then,
at the last minute, withdrew from the compact, saying that
the interests of Prussia did not require him to engage in a
war. Prussia was relieved from the rule of this weak and
vacillating individual, by his death in January, 1861.</p>

it), by a large number of “the women of England.” But we must
confess that our feelings are so strongly opposed to these “Baby

<p>The following poems are extracted from a scarce
and curious chap book recently purchased from
Mr. Salkeld, of 314, Clapham Road, from whom I
have obtained many literary curiosities, and much
useful information about books and their contents.
This little chap book is entitled</p>

<p class="center">FILIAL REMEMBRANCER.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p class="center ls"><i>SELECTION</i></p>

<p class="center">of the</p>

<p class="center">MUCH ADMIRED POEMS,</p>

<p class="center">MY FATHER, MY MOTHER, MY BROTHER, and<br />
MY SISTER.<br />
with the</p>

<p class="center">Father’s address to his children, in imitation of
Cowper.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p class="center">Banbury, <span class="sc">J. G. Rusher</span>.</p>

<p class="unindent">No date is given, nor are the names of the authors
mentioned, and although Miss Taylor’s poem is
printed in full no acknowledgment is made to her,
whilst the preface states that “the following tender
little poems, <em>imitating the style of one of Cowper’s</em>,
cannot be too widely circulated.” It would certainly
appear that Miss Taylor’s “My Mother” had served
as the model for imitation, rather than any poem by
Cowper. There are ten poems in all, four addressed
to <i>My Father</i>, three to <i>My Mother</i>, one to <i>My
Sister</i>, one to <i>My Brother</i>, and one entitled, <cite>The
Father’s Address to his Children</cite>. The preface
contains these quaint remarks:<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

 <p class="blockquote"> “Were something like the following committed to the memory
of children, and the care of their parents employed to cultivate an
<a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"></a><span class="pageno">134</span>
early acquaintance with the virtues inculcated in these little pieces,
it might be of infinite service to them in checking a refractory disposition;
or, by a line or verse running in their minds, melting down
a disobedient will into the most cheerful and ready compliance to a
parent’s wish. And what a delightful task for an enlightened
mother, when the shades of evening collect her young family round
the fire, to treasure these precepts in their tender minds! Methinks
I see her interesting audience, seated on their little stools, and
leaning on their elbows, attentively listening, while a Mary or a
Maria, a Henry or a William, to show their proficiency, repeat the
verses they have learnt; or sprightly interrupting the reciter by an
appeal to the mother if he be not wrong.”</p>

<p>A Readers idea of the state of the Editor’s mind

<div class="poemdivider">1.</div>
<div class="i1">I once, upon a summer’s day,</div>
<div class="i1">Strove to solve a solvent way</div>
<div class="i1">To escape from skulking sharks;&mdash;</div>
<div class="i3">For my heart was very sore,</div>
<div class="i1">And I ponder’d, ah, how sadly!</div>
<div class="i1">How I wanted money badly;</div>
<div class="i1">My salvation I’d sell gladly</div>
<div class="i2">For nimble notes, or gold galore,</div>
<div class="i1">To pay those damn’d and dastard duns,</div>
<div class="i2">And be, as I have been before,</div>
<div class="i3">Safe from duns for Evermore.</div>
<div class="poemdivider">2.</div>
<div class="i1">While I ponder’d, nearly sleeping,</div>
<div class="i1">Sad at soul, and nigh on weeping,</div>
<div class="i1">I reckon’d up my many friends;&mdash;</div>
<div class="i3">Care corroding my heart’s core,</div>
<div class="i1">Those for years that I had known,</div>
<div class="i1">Those who truth and trust had shown,</div>
<div class="i1">And those, alas! who rich had grown</div>
<div class="i2">And forgot they once were poor,</div>
<div class="i1">And could not see a seedy chum,</div>
<div class="i2">But in his face would close the door.</div>
<div class="i3">And neigh or bray him&mdash;“Nevermore.”</div>
<div class="poemdivider">3.</div>
<div class="i1">Yes, I’m like a dotless i,</div>
<div class="i1">And want and woe my wretched cry,</div>
<div class="i1">With stress of sad starvation,</div>
<div class="i3">Ah, me! it is a world of poor.</div>
<div class="i1">There’s not a little cur that barks,</div>
<div class="i1">Nor tiny birds, from wrens to larks,</div>
<div class="i1">Nor even skulking sheriff’s sharks,</div>
<div class="i2">Feel so sad, so sick and sore,</div>
<div class="i1">As I, most wretched, dotless I,</div>
<div class="i2">Doom’d for ever to be poor,</div>
<div class="i3">And dunn’d by tradesmen Evermore.</div>
<div class="poemdivider">4.</div>
<div class="i1">Even while I thus was thinking,</div>
<div class="i1">All my soul within me sinking,</div>
<div class="i1">Fathoms deep in dark despair,</div>
<div class="i3">A knock I heard at my front door,</div>
<div class="i1">Which set my heart most wildly beating,</div>
<div class="i1">And my blood to fever heating,</div>
<div class="i1">As, coward-like, I kept retreating,</div>
<div class="i2">Retreating to the basement floor,</div>
<div class="i1">There I whisper’d to the slavey,</div>
<div class="i2">Aged, I fancy, twenty-four,</div>
<div class="i3">“Say I’ve left for&mdash;Evermore.”</div>
<div class="poemdivider">5.</div>
<div class="i1">For my nerves received a shock,</div>
<div class="i1">I felt I knew that beastly knock,</div>
<div class="i1">The knock of man who takes possession;&mdash;</div>
<div class="i3">And it went to my heart’s core</div>
<div class="i1">To lose my little household gods,</div>
<div class="i1">My wear, my gear, and fishing-rods,</div>
<div class="i1">All, all my sacred ends and odds,</div>
<div class="i2">That cost at least of pounds a score,&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">All to go at one fell swoop,</div>
<div class="i2">With tearful eyes I glanced them o’er,</div>
<div class="i3">And sadly murmur’d,&mdash;“Nevermore.”</div>
<div class="poemdivider">6.</div>
<div class="i1">Yes, it was the sheriffs man;</div>
<div class="i1">Like all his ugly kith and clan&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">The seedy, dirty, beery lot,</div>
<div class="i3">Blood-shot eyes and red and sore.</div>
<div class="i1">Then this vile and venomous vulture,</div>
<div class="i1">Devoid of every civil culture,</div>
<div class="i1">And meanly meaning to insult yer,</div>
<div class="i2">Spits upon your carpet floor,</div>
<div class="i1">Lights his foul, ill-smelling pipe,&mdash;</div>
<div class="i2">Stuft’d with plug of negro core,&mdash;</div>
<div class="i3">Sits and spits for&mdash;Evermore.</div>
<div class="poemdivider">7.</div>
<div class="i1">“Wretch!” I cry, with sudden start</div>
<div class="i1">“From this second let us part,</div>
<div class="i1">Get thee gone, possessing devil,</div>
<div class="i3">Let me never see thee more.”</div>
<div class="i1">My voice I raise as thus I cry,</div>
<div class="i1">And anger gleams within my eye;</div>
<div class="i1">Then the demon made reply,&mdash;</div>
<div class="i2">“’Tis only thirty pounds, not more,</div>
<div class="i1">So, sir, ’tis you, not I, must ‘part,’</div>
<div class="i2">If not, why then”&mdash;here he swore&mdash;</div>
<div class="i3">“I shall stay here&mdash;Evermore.”</div>
<div class="poemdivider">8.</div>
<div class="i1">And that vulture, never soaring,</div>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">A Welcome to Battenberg.</span></p>

<p>Shortly after it was publicly announced that the Queen
had given her consent to the marriage of the Princess
Beatrice with Prince Henry of Battenberg, the following
paragraph appeared in <cite>Funny Folks</cite>:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Certain members of the Royal Family do not like the betrothed
of the Princess Beatrice. This may be; but, anyway, nobody will
deny that if we have a Poet Laureate, he ought now and again do
something for his salary. Whether any rumours have reached Lord
Tennyson on the subject, I can’t say; but it is a remarkable fact
that the day after such an opinion was expressed in this office
the following communication was dropped into the editorial box:</p>

<p>The above lines appeared in large type, and a prominent
position, in the <cite>Times</cite> of Thursday, April 23rd, 1885.
Many persons thought a hoax had been played on the
<cite>Times</cite>, refusing to believe that such a dismal appeal ad
<i>captandum vulgus</i> could have been penned by the Poet
Laureate. Although it is true that all his recent productions
have given signs of failing powers, both intellectual
and poetical, nothing yet has been published so
damaging as this to the reputation of the author of “The
Idylls of the King.” It is, indeed, greatly to be regretted that
he has no sincere and discriminating friend who could
kindly, but firmly, dissuade him from the publication of
such lines, which pain his friends, and give rise to endless
satires at his expense. Journals representing all parties
and every shade of opinion, at once set to work to ridicule
<cite>The Fleet</cite>, and numerous parodies of it have already
appeared, from which the following are selected:<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>[This poem is founded upon two erroneous assumptions,
namely that the explosion at the Admiralty was caused by
dynamite, and that it was of Fenian origin. Colonel
Majendie has expressed his confident opinion that the
explosion was caused by the firing of about 12-lbs. of gunpowder
enclosed in a metal pot; and the personal
unpopularity of the unfortunate Mr. Swainson is considered
a far more likely cause for the outrage, than any
political motive.]</p>

N</span> giving the following Parodies on detached
passages from the plays of
Shakespeare, it must be stated, (though
such a statement ought to be perfectly
unnecessary,) that not the slightest disrespect
is intended, either to the works themselves,
or to that great author whose name, and fame, are
dear to every Englishman.</p>

<p>Nearly every play written by Shakespeare has
been burlesqued, and whenever one of the London
theatrical managers produces a grand revival of a
Shakespearian tragedy, a travestie of it is almost
immediately produced, at one, or another, of the
smaller houses, which provide fun for the laughter-loving
public. There are many worthy people
who take offence at this, and fail to see that such
fun is of a very harmless description, and that no
disrespect is intended to the immortal bard, who
was not, himself, above introducing burlesques of
his contemporaries, even in his most serious works.</p>

<p>This question was fully discussed in the London
daily papers in August, 1883, <i>àpropos</i> of burlesques
of <cite>The Tempest</cite>, and <cite>Hamlet</cite>, produced by Mr.
John Hollingshead, at the Gaiety Theatre. Some
of the letters then published throw considerable
light on what had been previously done in the way
of Shakespearian burlesques, and are also of interest
as summing up the arguments, for and against,
Parody and Burlesque in general.</p>

<p>Mr. Moy Thomas, the theatrical critic of the
<cite>Daily News</cite>, thus introduced the subject in his
weekly column, entitled<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="center">THE THEATRES.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“We have received the following letter on the subject of
the impending burlesques of ‘The Tempest,’ and ‘Hamlet,’
at the Gaiety Theatre. We may remind our readers that
we described the project as ‘somewhat startling,’ while
we called attention to the facts that the productions in

question are to be avowedly ‘elaborate parodies,’ and that
there is reason to believe that ‘if this experiment should be
found to be suited to the tastes of the town Mr. Burnand’s
process of adapting Shakespeare to “nineteenth century
audiences” may be expected to continue.’ More than this,
in the way of protest, it did not in the present stage of the
project seem to us necessary to say in a column which is
mainly devoted to dramatic news.”</p>

<p class="blockquote">“‘May I ask if it is possible that the dramatic critic of
the <cite>Daily News</cite> means to pass over without a word of
disapprobation the proposal to burlesque “Hamlet” and
“The Tempest?” I think many people must have been as
surprised as I was to read your intimation of it in last
Monday’s issue uncoupled with any word of disapproval
or disgust. Surely the English stage may well be thought
by Englishmen to have reached its lowest point of degradation,
and one strangely in contrast with the honour we
profess to pay to it, when two of the finest plays and finest
works in all literature are to be sacrificed to the passion
for burlesque. We had better consider ourselves no
longer the same nation, and cease to pride ourselves on
having produced the foremost man in all literature when
we descend to this without protest. I do not think any
language can be too strong on such a subject from a lover
of Shakespeare and of the stage, and one who cannot but
contrast the present tastes of the public with the opinion
formed of them by Milton two centuries ago;&mdash;“What
wants there to such a towardly and pregnant soil but wise
and faithful labourers to make a knowing people, a nation
of prophets, of sages, and of worthies.’”&mdash;I am yours
faithfully, <span class="sc">W. Kennedy</span>.&mdash;Hampstead, August 16.”</p>

<p class="center">&mdash;&mdash;<i>:o:</i>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>A few days later the following replies were published
in <cite>The Daily News</cite>:<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="blockquote">Sir,&mdash;Your correspondent “Mr. Kennedy” speaks of a
proposed new version of <cite>The Tempest</cite>, of a more or less
burlesque character, as if I and Mr. Burnand had discovered
a new crime. <cite>The World</cite> (in the absence of Mr.
Yates) also follows suit. Messrs. F. Talfourd, Andrew
Halliday, Robert Brough, and others were not afraid to
to draw upon Shakespeare for their burlesques, and in the
so-called “palmy days” of the drama the parodies of
Shakespeare were frequent, coarse, and brutal. The
subjects of many of Shakespeare’s plays were the common
property of the dramatist long before the advent of the
master, and if he were now alive he would probably be
the last to object to treatment such as Goethe has received
in every city in Europe.&mdash;I am, &amp;c., <span class="sc">John
Hollingshead</span>.&mdash;Gaiety Theatre, Strand.”</p>

<p class="blockquote">Sir,&mdash;This stir about The <cite>Tempest</cite> seems a storm in a
teacup. Both “Mr. W. Kennedy, of Hampstead,” who
naturally takes high ground, and your dramatic critic
would have acted more justly to my forthcoming piece had
they waited to see what it was before attempting to excite
public prejudice against my work. There is an important
distinction between what is commonly understood by
“burlesquing Shakespeare,” by which is meant taking his
lines and sentiments and giving them an absurd turn, and
writing what is now-a-days styled a “burlesque version”
<span class="pageno">145</span>
(which is really an extravaganza) of a fairy tale which
Shakespeare has immortalised, especially when Shakespeare
himself has given the keynote for the fun, as he has
done in <cite>The Tempest</cite>, no doubt with a full consciousness
of its humour.</p>

<p class="blockquote">As the lawyer’s wisdom is popularly supposed to reside
mainly in the wig, so the poet has made all Prospero’s
magic art lie in his book, wand, and magic robes, without
which he is powerless. When he does not wish to be
professionally engaged he puts aside his “magic properties”
and says “lie there my art.” When he is renouncing
conjuring he buries his books of legerdemain, and has
done with it for ever, retaining no sort of power independently
of this magic receipt book, or as I shall struggle
not to call it, in deference to Mr. Kennedy, of Hampstead
to whom a pun on anything Shakespearian must appear
quite too-too dreadful, his “spelling book.” Caliban is
aware of this, and directs his efforts to possessing himself
of this book. This perfectly admissible view of Prospero,
together with the notion that he himself gives as to Ariel’s
true character, has furnished me with the materials for an
extravaganza at the Gaiety, which will be entitled
<cite>Ariel, or, the King of the Caliban Island</cite>, of which the critics
and public will form their judgment when it appears. <i>En
attendant</i>, to raise a prejudice against my work is clearly
unjust. Let me have fairplay even for an extravaganza
founded on a Shakespearian fairy tale. “Atlas,” in the
<cite>World</cite>, had an unfair note on this subject. I have written
to him much as I have to you, but with a special “P.S.,”
which I trust he will have the generosity to publish, pointing
out that “Atlas” should be the last to brand as a
crime burlesquing anything Shakesperian, as in his own
paper a few weeks ago appeared the story of <cite>Hamlet</cite>
travestied, and adapted to “nineteenth century” readers.&mdash;Yours
faithfully,</p>

<p class="quotesig"><span class="sc">F. C. Burnand.</span></p>

<p class="center">&mdash;&mdash;<i>:o:</i>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">(To the Editor of the <cite>Daily News</cite>.)&mdash;Sir,&mdash;We are told
that a parody in three or four acts of <cite>The Tempest</cite> is in
preparation, and we are asked by the author to suspend
judgment until its production. The appeal is at any rate
superficially fair. But Mr. Burnand’s letter is not very
reassuring. For instance, he calls the great play “a fairy
tale,” i.e., he seems to put it on a level with “The White
Cat” and “Puss in Boots.” But let that pass. All who
reverence the great name of Shakespeare, and who are
grateful for his noble plays (and they are numerous, whatever
Mr. Burnand and <cite>Punch</cite> may think), will patiently
await <cite>The King of the Caliban Island</cite> (what charming wit
and taste!) leaning upon their swords. In any case
Shakespeare’s memory cannot suffer. What is to be
feared is the degradation of the stage which he ennobled,
and of the actors and dramatic authors of whom he ought
to be the proudest and most sacred boast.&mdash;I am, Sir,
yours faithfully, <span class="sc">An Old Playgoer</span>.</p>

<p class="quotesig">August 20, 1883.</p>

<p class="center">&mdash;&mdash;<i>:o:</i>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>In the next weekly column of <cite>The Theatres</cite>
(August 27, 1883,) Mr. Moy Thomas inserted
another long letter, which had been addressed to
him by Mr. F. C. Burnand, referring to his forthcoming
burlesque upon Shakespeare’s <cite>Tempest</cite>:<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="blockquote">“I know you are not friendly to burlesques&mdash;and probably
not to burlesque writers; still, as a critic, as a judge who
will have to try the case, it is hardly fair to range yourself
on the adverse side, and to make your verdict a foregone
conclusion. Patience a moment, and hear&mdash;or read. The
existence of Robson was an excuse for a burlesque on <i>Shylock</i>,

and for one on <i>Macbeth</i>; also on <i>Medea</i>. Now, in
looking about for a character, a novelty, for Miss Nelly
Farren, who <em>is</em> a genius in <em>her</em> way, as Robson was in <em>his</em>&mdash;the
notion of <em>an</em> Ariel struck me, and the more I considered
it the more I liked it. I read the <cite>Tempest</cite> carefully, and
saw how Shakespeare had given the chance of such a view
of Ariel as the spirit of enterprise, and had struck the keynote
of any amount of fun in the humorous notion of Prospero
being absolutely dependent upon his “properties” for his
magic power. Evidently he had not had them with him
when he was turned adrift by Gonzago in a boat with his
child; or rather, as he must have had them with him
(according to his own account) they were so packed up he
couldn’t get at them; otherwise, where would his enemies
have been? Caliban’s one idea was to possess himself of
the book. Well, in him I see a backward boy (done out of
his rights, by the way), who, however, wants to acquire
knowledge, and who does so in the end. How dull Miranda
found the island you can judge from her speeches, and from
her going to sleep when her father is prosing. The conspirators,
and the remorseful king, are minor characters,
calling for no particular remark, except as padding to sustain
a weakish plot. Now what do I do? Burlesque it? Not
in the sense in which I understand burlesque, as, for
instance, I burlesqued <i>Fédora</i>, <i>Diplomacy</i>, Ouida’s <i>Strathmore</i>,
&amp;c., &amp;c. No; but I take the story and give it a turn
similar (though not the same) to what Thackeray gave to
<i>Ivanhoe</i> in <i>Rebecca and Rowena</i>. He took up the tale where
Scott left off, but he reproduced the scenes and characters
under changed conditions. I take the story with its leading
characters; I omit the tempest entirely (only a sea-fog,
when Prospero had forecasted a “disturbance”), and Ariel,
capable of assuming all sorts of shapes and forms, does so
and wrecks the ship. The arrangement of scenes doesn’t
follow the play. Of course Trinculo and Stephano are not
in it, for no one making a new comic story could take them or
Caliban as far as he is associated with them and make them
more funny, whether in dialogue or in business (I know it
all, having studied it) than they are in the piece. No one
<em>could</em> take the <cite>Midsummer Night’s Dream</cite> and produce a
modern extravaganza, though they might (as Planché did)
use the fairies out of it, who are immortal. No one
deprecates a vulgar, coarse piece of buffoonery by way of
burlesque more than I do. I have undertaken this very
work as an advance on <i>Blue Beard</i>, as <i>Blue Beard</i> was
(though you would not recognise it) a distinct advance on
what had preceded it. It forms one of the “burlesque
drama” series&mdash;a generic title to which I have objections,
but by which Mr. John Hollingshead sets store&mdash;and as it is
a matter of indifference to the public whether what is really
an extravaganza comes under the above heading, I havn’t
any more to say, but the sum is that I am distinctly not burlesquing
Shakespeare’s <cite>Tempest</cite>, as by burlesquing I understand
my mode of treatment of Sardou’s <cite>Fédora</cite>, <cite>Diplomacy</cite>,
Ouida’s <cite>Strathmore</cite>, &amp;c., &amp;c.”</p>

<p>In September 1883, Mr. Hollingshead also wrote
to the <cite>Daily News</cite> as follows:<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="blockquote">“It may interest those who are curious in theatrical
history to learn that the last London performance of “The
Enchanted Isle,” a burlesque upon Shakespeare’s
“Tempest,” by William and Robert Brough, was played
at Drury Lane Theatre on the 25th July, 1860, for the
benefit of the widow and children of Robert Brough, one
of the authors. The cast was as follows: Ariel, Miss
Kate Terry, (then in the height of her popularity); Ferdinand,
Mrs. Alfred Mellon (Miss Woolgar); Miranda,
Miss Fanny Stirling (a daughter of Mrs. Stirling, her first
appearance on the stage); Caliban, Mr. F. Talfourd;
Alonzo, Mr. George Cruikshank; Prospero, Mr. Leicester
Buckingham; and Trinculo, by the writer of this note.”</p>
<a name="Page_146" id="Page_146"></a><span class="pageno">146</span>

<p>Mr. Moy Thomas followed up this letter by
stating that:<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="blockquote">“Mr. Burnand and has unearthed in the British Museum
library an acting copy of Davenant and Dryden’s version
of the “Tempest; or the Enchanted Isle,” which he will
probably expound for the benefit of readers in an early
number of <cite>Punch</cite>. Sir Walter Scott’s account of this
piece is perhaps worth transcribing here:&mdash;‘It seems
probable that Dryden furnished the language, and Davenant
the plan, of the new characters introduced. They
do but little honour to his invention, although Dryden
has highly extolled it in his preface. The idea of a
counterpart to Shakspeare’s plot by introducing a man
who had never seen a woman, as a contrast to a woman
who had never seen a man, and by furnishing Caliban
with a sister-monster, seems hardly worthy of the delight
with which Dryden says he filled up the characters so
sketched. In mixing his tints Dryden did not omit that
peculiar colouring in which his age delighted. Miranda’s
simplicity is converted into indelicacy…. The play seems
to have succeeded to the utmost wish of the authors. It
was brought out in the Duke’s house [Lincoln’s-inn-fields
Theatre, November, 1667], of which Davenant was the
manager, with all the splendour of scenic decoration of
which he was the inventor. The opening scene was described
as being particularly splendid, and the performance
of the spirits with mops and mows excited general
applause!’”</p>

<p class="center">Hamlet’s Soliloquy.</p>

<p>No one passage from the plays of Shakespeare
has been so frequently parodied, and imitated, as
the celebrated Soliloquy commencing “<span class="sc">To be, or
not to be</span>.” The following version of the original
is taken from the famous Folio edition of
Shakespeare’s works put forth in 1623. In addition
to the quaint orthography, there are one or
two verbal differences between this, and the
version given in modern editions of the poet’s
works; notably the expression “the poor man’s
contumely,” which is now generally printed as “the
proud man’s contumely:”<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<span class="sc">Scene</span>&mdash;<i>Opposite the Turkish Bath, West Street, Brighton.</i></div>
<div class="i1"><i>Ham.</i>&mdash;To bathe, or not to bathe,&mdash;that is the question;</div>
<div class="i2">Whether ’tis wiser in a man to suffer</div>
<div class="i2">The aches and pangs of disordered nature,</div>
<div class="i2">Or to take baths against a sea of troubles</div>
<div class="i2">And by so doing end them? To strip&mdash;to sweat,</div>
<div class="i2">No more; and, by a roast, to say we end</div>
<div class="i2">The headache, and a thousand natural ills</div>
<div class="i2">That flesh is heir to,&mdash;’tis a consummation</div>
<div class="i2">Devoutly to be wish’d. To strip,&mdash;to sweat:&mdash;</div>
<div class="i2">To sweat! and be shampooed:&mdash;aye, there’s the rub;</div>
<div class="i2">For in that heat such evils may remove</div>
<div class="i2">We need not shuffle off this mortal coil,</div>
<div class="i2">But save our lives. ’Tis this experience</div>
<div class="i2">That makes so many take the Turkish Bath;</div>
<div class="i2">For who would bear the whips and stings of pain,</div>
<div class="i2">The consumptive’s cough, the fat man’s obesity,</div>
<div class="i2">The pangs of dyspepsia, or Bright’s disease,</div>
<div class="i2">The torturings of asthma, or the woes</div>
<div class="i2">That Alcohol upon the inebriate brings,</div>
<div class="i2">When he himself might his deliverance take</div>
<div class="i2">With a bare body? Who would rheumatism bear,</div>
<div class="i2">And grunt and groan under a weary life?</div>
<div class="i2">But that an ignorance of Turkish baths,</div>
<div class="i2">Those re-discovered pleasures, unto which</div>
<div class="i2">Wise travellers return, doth still prevail,</div>
<div class="i2">And makes us tamely bear those ills we have,</div>
<div class="i2">Heedless of remedies that we know not of.</div>
<div class="i2">Thus ignorance oft makes wretches of us all;</div>
<div class="i2">And thus the native hue of health and vigour</div>
<div class="i2">Is sicklied o’er with the pallor of disease.</div>
<div class="i2">But thus, I ween, it shall not be with me;</div>
<div class="i2">The good I know, and oft have tried, again</div>
<div class="i2">I will embrace. Clerk, in thy dressing rooms</div>
<div class="i2">Hast thou a place for me?</div>

<p>The Electors of Barrhead, by 570 to 317, have gone
against erecting their town into a Burgh. Coatbridge, with
a population of 20,000 or 30,000, is also agitating on this
subject. Saltcotians are meantime deeply interested in the
question&mdash;and the struggle between the burgh and anti-burgh
party, as must always be the case when the powers of dirt
and darkness, and light and cleanliness, come into collision
with each other, promises to be a keen one. According to a
native residing in Glasgow, “Insider” ruminates and thus
soliloquises:<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="i1">For from that Vote what tyranny may come,</div>
<div class="i1">When we have wriggled from Obstruction’s coil</div>

<div class="i1">That makes endurance of so long a life.</div>

<div class="i1">That patient <span class="sc">Forster</span> of rude <span class="sc">Healy</span> takes,</div>

<div class="i1">That glory of our country, whose wide bourn</div>
<div class="i1">No Liberal would limit, clogs the will,</div>
<div class="i1">And makes us rather bear the ills we have,</div>
<div class="i1">Than fly to others that we may not measure.</div>
<div class="i1">Thus caution does make cowards of us all;</div>
<div class="i1">And thus the Statesman’s native resolution,</div>

<p>Compromise or no compromise, that is&mdash;one <em>must</em> of

and, by opposing, end the Lords&mdash;or mend them. To speak,
to vote&mdash;no more; and by a vote to end the heart-ache, and

to go on any longer in this strain. In fact, the strain’s too
much. Perhaps it will prove too much for his Lordship.

<div class="i1">The jeers and scorns of men; the employer’s</div>

<div class="i1">A pleasant slice, perhaps, taken off one’s nose;</div>

<div class="i1">Devoutly to be wish’d. To eat;&mdash;to stuff;&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">To gorge, perchance be sick! aye, there’s the rub;</div>
<div class="i1">For in that yearning state what pangs may come,</div>
<div class="i1">In easing me of superfluities,</div>
<div class="i1">Must make me pause:&mdash;’tis this alone</div>
<div class="i1">That bids me curb my longing appetite;</div>
<div class="i1">Else should I tamely bear fell hunger’s cries,</div>
<div class="i1">My stomach’s wrongs, my bowels’ piercing shrieks,</div>
<div class="i1">My greedy eye’s desire, the cook’s delay,</div>
<div class="i1">Who, insolent in office, jade-like taunts</div>

<div class="i1">Thus sickness does make cowards of us all;</div>
<div class="i1">And thus fell resolution, arm’d by want,</div>

<p>[Concerning this William Henry Ireland, and his Shakespearian
forgeries, it will be necessary to speak at length in
some future number of <cite>Parodies</cite>, for the present it will
suffice to mention that he composed a Tragedy, entitled
<cite>Vortigern</cite>, which he passed off as a newly discovered work
by Shakespeare. The forgery deceived some of the most
learned and able critics of the day, and at length, Richard
Brinsley Sheridan was prevailed upon to produce it at
Drury Lane Theatre. It was only played once, on the
second of April, 1796, when Mr. Kemble appeared as
Vortigern, Miss Miller as Rowena, and the beautiful Mrs.
Jordan as Flavia. The public, more accurate in their
judgment than the critics, good humouredly laughed the
piece down, and when Kemble had to speak the line:<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="center">“And when this solemn mockery is o’er,”</p>

<p class="unindent">the audience received it in such a manner that the fate of
the tragedy was sealed. Ireland’s ingenious devices and
plausible manner had convinced several learned and prominent
men of the authenticity of the Shakesperian M.S.S.
and, as might have been expected, when the imposition was
discovered, there were many bitter caricatures and satires
published at his expense. One of these, dated December
1797, is a portrait of Ireland, grasping a volume of Shakespeare,
with a motto, taken from the <cite>Maid of the Mill</cite>:<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="unindent">It is said that Ireland was so enraged at this publication
that he broke the shop windows where it was exposed for

<p>After <cite>Vortigern and Rowena</cite> had been once played, and
the audience had testified in the most unmistakable manner
their disbelief in its authenticity, and contempt for its
merits, Ireland yet had the audacity to urge Sheridan and
Kemble to have a second trial; Sheridan, however, dismissed
him with an emphatic negative. After Ireland had
left the room, Kemble said, “Well, Sir, you cannot doubt
that the play is a forgery.” “Damn the fellow,” replied
Sheridan, “<cite>I believe his face is a forgery</cite>, he is the most

<p>This little Journal was published in Southampton during
the stirring times just previous to the election of the Parliament
which settled the first great Reform Bill. <cite>The Argus</cite>
strongly advocated the cause of Reform, supporting the candidatures
of Messrs. <span class="sc">Atherley &amp; Penleaze</span>, in opposition to
Messrs. <span class="sc">Dottin &amp; Hoy</span>. At the election <span class="sc">Atherley</span> polled
732 votes; <span class="sc">Penleaze</span> 663, whereas <span class="sc">Hoy</span> had only 391
votes, and with the general victory of the Reform question
the necessity for such a political journal as <cite>The Argus</cite> was at
an end. It contains many parodies satirising the prominent

<p>One of the best burlesques of Shakespeare ever
written was the “Hamlet Travestie, in three Acts,
with annotations after the manner of Dr. Johnson
and George Steevens, Esq., and other Commentators,”
1810. This was written by John Poole,
the author of Paul Pry; the notes at the end are
amusing burlesques of the word-splitting, and
quibbling over trifles, to be found in the writings of
many authors who have done their best to obscure
some of the clearest, and noblest utterances of
Shakespeare.</p>

a share, losses on the Derby, tightness of the money-market,
the impertinence of the fellow who keeps on calling for the

is obliged to put up with from all kinds of cads and humbugs,
and stuck-up little beasts, who give themselves no end of
airs, and try to ride rough-shod over everybody who has not
had the same luck that they have&mdash;than to terminate one’s
existence by an act of <em>felo-de-se</em>? Well, you know, the fact
is that nobody would be fool enough to go on day after day
standing this sort of thing, if it wasn’t for a deuced strong
objection to becoming a body, and being sat upon by a
dozen tradesmen, some of whom perhaps have been confoundedly
rude to one in one’s life, when one has not
happened to be able to pay one’s bills the moment one has
been called upon in a sudden and peremptory, not to say
insolent, manner to do so. There’s the rub! On consideration,
most people will rather bear the ills they have than do
anything desperate to get rid of them. (I have but this
moment met with a passage in a shocking tragedy, by the
well-known Shakespeare, that bears a decided family likeness
to my philosophic proposition. It will scarcely be expected
that I should expunge the foregoing observations, because of
their likeness to what was written at a distant period of

<p>Mr. F. J. Furnivall’s fussy and hasty “tries to set
everybody right” about all that relates to Shakespeare
are well-known, as is also his objection to any
contradiction of his favorite theories.</p>

<p>The “New Shakspere Society” was apparently
founded by Mr. F. J. Furnivall for two purposes,
firstly, for the glorification of Mr. Furnivall, and
secondly, to instruct the British public to spell the
name of Shakespeare in a different manner to that
commonly adopted, and which was generally used
by his contemporaries. If the Society has partially
succeeded in its first object, it has totally failed in the
second; when the press does condescend to notice
its proceedings it is almost invariably styled the
New <i>Shakespeare</i> Society, notwithstanding the
anger, and the constant protests of Mr. F. J.
Furnivall. A pretty controversy was raised on
the question of <em>Shakespeare</em> or <em>Shakspere</em> between
J. O. Halliwell-Phillipps&mdash;who is an authority, and
Mr. Furnivall, who is&mdash;simply Mr. Furnivall. The
latter gentleman’s arguments, expressed in peculiar
diction, and still more peculiar orthography, consisted
principally of personalities, and Mr. A. C.
Swinburne (who happened to disagree with him)

was styled a <em>minor</em> poet, and his name translated
into pigs-brook (from swine&mdash;a pig, and burne&mdash;a
brook) by the courteous founder of the “New
Shakspere Society.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_34" id="fnanchor_34"></a><a href="#footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Hamlet from a new point of view.</span></p>

<p class="blockquote">“Seeing an announcement to the effect that ‘Hamlet’ is

bit about the matter; and I give in a free and unstudied
manner the fruits of my thoughts. First, I wondered if one out
of ten who’d read the bills would know anything really about
either the play or the poet? Of the difference between the

<p class="blockquote">Let us look at this Prince, almost a fairy one, thirty years
of age, too good for the earth, not good enough for Heaven.
You know what he says: ‘What should such fellows as I do
crawling between earth and heaven?’</p>

<p class="blockquote">Well, instead of being thin as in the picture, and fancy he
is; by his mother’s, the queen’s, words, ‘He’s fat, and scant
of breath. Heere’s a napkin, rub thy browes, the Queen
carowses to thy fortune, Hamlet.’ Of course it’s very well
to wriggle and say oh, that, like the ‘beard,’ was put in to
suit Burbage. Even letting this be the case, Shakespeare
studied an actor more than the reputation of his first work.
Then he is so poetical and wanting in action, so unable to
grapple with the wicked things of this world.</p>

<p class="blockquote">Oh! is he. When the king ships him to Britain, he puts
the names of his false friends where his own stood, so that
the British king has them beheaded and not Hamlet.</p>

<p class="blockquote">Now for the Queen, and Laertes, and the King. Of a
sudden, like acted upon by a magician’s wand, they turn bad
all at once. It even worries and bothers Hamlet. He can’t

understand why his mother should have taken so queer a
fancy as to prefer his uncle to his far handsomer father.
And Laertes who gives such nice advice to his sister, and for
his cad-like conduct receives a very proper rebuke from her,
turns from a seemingly-virtuous young gentleman to a mean
and despicable assassin. And Ophelia, that beauteous and
correct damsel, is easily made to act as a spy upon her lover.
And this without one word of caution to him, or the least
expression of regret for such, at the mildest, unlady-like,
unwoman-like, and altogether unchristian-like conduct.</p>

<p class="blockquote">Other minor faults and absurdities occur, as Hamlet’s
remark after he had seen his father’s spirit:<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="blockquote">‘The undiscovered country from whose bourn no traveller
returns.’</p>

<p class="blockquote">This Hamlet may in some shadowy way or other forecast
our life here and what the majority of us do in it&mdash;nothing.
Leave all to the crack of doom and then down we go all
together. Our talking as angels, some of us, and acting like
fools, most of us, may be all here parabled out.”</p>

<p>As Mr. Wilson Barrett’s revival of <i>Hamlet</i> was
a success, it was quite in the order of things that it
should be burlesqued, and that he and the members
of his company should be caricatured.</p>

<p>“Very Little Hamlet,” by W. Yardley, was produced
at the Gaiety Theatre, London, in November,
1884, and Mr. Wilson Barrett’s absurd speech
about his early ambition to play <i>Hamlet</i> was made
the leading idea in the prologue, the scene representing
the exterior of the Princess’s twenty-five
years ago, with costumes, &amp;c., archæologically
correct. The future proprietor appears as a ragged
street boy, and takes his solemn oath, to mysterious
music, that he will, one day, play <i>Hamlet</i> in that
theatre, while his companions of the gutter, being
called upon to swear, exclaim in a hoarse whisper,
“D&mdash;&mdash;n!” and a ghostly actor undertakes to see
the scheme carried out. Miss Nelly Farren appeared
as the hero, and Miss Phyllis Broughton as
Ophelia, with a tow-like wig. The treatment of
the play scene was novel and amusing. It was
announced that the principal player was ill and
could not perform, whereupon King Claudius kindly
volunteered to go on and read the part, which he
did, until he discovered the meaning of the show.</p>

<p>In 1839 Messrs. Whittaker &amp; <abbr title="Company">Co.</abbr>, of Ave Maria
Lane, London, published a quarto volume entitled
“The Barrow Diggers, a Dialogue in imitation of

the Grave Diggers in Hamlet.” The work, which
was published anonymously, had numerous illustrations
of Barrows found in various parts of the
country, and of the Antiquities, Arms, Pottery, and
human remains found in them. The parody relates
entirely to the excavations in the Barrows, carried
on by antiquaries in search of curiosities, and the
notes explanatory of the parody, form the chief
and most interesting portion of the work.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Scene.</span> A Barrow on a Common.</p>

<p class="unindent"><i>Enter three Barrow Diggers with spades, shovels, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p class="widehang">1st <abbr title="Barrow Digger"><span class="sc lowercase">B. D.</span></abbr>&mdash;Is this a Roman, or a British Barrow?</p>

<p class="widehang">2nd <abbr title="Barrow Digger"><span class="sc lowercase">B. D.</span></abbr>&mdash;I tell thee ’tis a British Barrow, therefore
straightways open it; Antiquarius hath set on
it, and finds it British Burial.</p>

<p class="widehang">1st <abbr title="Barrow Digger"><span class="sc lowercase">B. D.</span></abbr>&mdash;How can that be, if Roman Ornaments and
arms should here be found?</p>

<p class="widehang">2nd <abbr title="Barrow Digger"><span class="sc lowercase">B. D.</span></abbr>&mdash;They may be found.</p>

<p class="widehang">1st <abbr title="Barrow Digger"><span class="sc lowercase">B. D.</span></abbr>&mdash;It must be Roman, it cannot be British Burial.
For here lies the point; if Roman arms and
ornaments are found in it, it argues a Roman
Act; and a Barrow Act hath three Branches,
to Act, to Dig, to Shovel; we go to work
willingly.</p>

<p class="widehang">3rd <abbr title="Barrow Digger"><span class="sc lowercase">B. D.</span></abbr>&mdash;Nay; but hear you good friend!</p>

<p class="widehang">1st <abbr title="Barrow Digger"><span class="sc lowercase">B. D.</span></abbr>&mdash;Give me leave. Here is a Common; good;
here is the Barrow; good; if the Barrow
contains Roman Arms, or urns, it must be
a Roman Barrow; mark you that; but if
spear heads made of flints, and British Arms
are here, it must be a British Barrow; if
nought but an empty cist, <i>tumulus inanis</i>, (or
an empty tomb raised by the Romans in
memory of a friend whose body could not be
found.) He that is not inclined to dig, shortens
not our work.</p>

<p class="widehang">2nd <abbr title="Barrow Digger"><span class="sc lowercase">B. D.</span></abbr>&mdash;But is this Barrow Law?</p>

<p class="widehang">1st <abbr title="Barrow Digger"><span class="sc lowercase">B. D.</span></abbr>&mdash;Ay, marry is’t Antiquarius’s Barrow Law.</p>

<p class="widehang">2nd <abbr title="Barrow Digger"><span class="sc lowercase">B. D.</span></abbr>&mdash;Will you ha’ the truth on’t? If this had been
a Roman relic of funeral pomp, it would have
been a very different sort of Burial. The
Romans raised not Barrows o’er their Dead.</p>

<p class="widehang">1st <abbr title="Barrow Digger"><span class="sc lowercase">B. D.</span></abbr>&mdash;Why there thou say’st: and the more pity
that great folks shall countenance the grandeur
of gaudy funerals, more than their poorer
neighbours. To my mind they are mighty like
representations of Death carrying off his
wealthy victims in Triumph. Come my spade,
There are no antient gentlemen, but Gardeners
Geologists, and Barrow Diggers; they hold up
Adam’s profession.</p>

<p class="widehang">3rd <abbr title="Barrow Digger"><span class="sc lowercase">B. D.</span></abbr>&mdash;Was he a Gentleman?</p>

<p class="widehang">1st <abbr title="Barrow Digger"><span class="sc lowercase">B. D.</span></abbr>&mdash;He was the first that ever bore Arms, a mattoc
shovel, and a spade.</p>

<p class="widehang">2nd <abbr title="Barrow Digger"><span class="sc lowercase">B. D.</span></abbr>&mdash;Why he had none.</p>

<p class="widehang">1st <abbr title="Barrow Digger"><span class="sc lowercase">B. D.</span></abbr>&mdash;What, art a heathen? How dost thou understand
the Scripture? The scripture says,
Adam digged. Could he dig without arms?
I’ll put another question to thee; if thou
answerest me not to the purpose, confess
thyself.</p>

Your worm is your only Emperor for diet: we

for maggots. Your fat King and your
lean skeleton is but variable service; two

of liquor.</p>

<p>[The remainder of the conversation relates to a controversy, now
well-nigh forgotten, as to the identification of a skull said to have
been that of Eugene Aram, who was executed at Tyburn, in 1759 for
the murder of Daniel Clark. At the Newcastle Meeting of the
British Association in 1838, a skull was produced as that of Eugene
Aram, but as it had passed through many hands during the eighty
years that had elapsed since his death, its authenticity was much
questioned, especially as one eminent anatomist declared it to be
the skull of a female.</p>

<p>In quoting this imitation of a scene from Hamlet, justice can
hardly be done to the scarce volume from which it is taken, without
quoting the instructive explanatory notes which accompany it.</p>

<p>Since 1839 great strides have been made in the general knowledge
of the subjects this book deals with, yet considering the date at
which it was produced it is remarkable not only for the facts it
records, but for the theories it advances.</p>

<p>Barrows are artificial heaps of earth, sometimes surrounded by a
narrow trench. They were reared by the early inhabitants of these
isles, and their contents afford almost the only insight we have into
the history of the Ancient Britons. Antiquaries are generally
agreed that they were raised for sepulchral interments, as in them
are usually found cists, with urns, human bones, spear and arrowheads
of flint, hammers, and celts of stone, beads, buckles, pins, etc.</p>

<p>The Cists, which vary in size and shape from two to eight feet
deep by three and four feet in diameter, are usually cut in chalk, and
contain the urns, skeletons, etc.]</p>

<div class="i1">With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,</div>
<div class="i1">Full of wise saws and modern instances;</div>

<div class="i6">&mdash;&mdash;“The world’s a stage,”</div>
<div class="i3">And Man has seven ages,”&mdash;</div>
<div class="i3">So Shakespeare writes (king of dramatic sages!)</div>
<div class="i3">But he forgot to tell you, in his plan,</div>
<div class="i3">That Woman plays her part, as well as Man.</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i3">First, how the Infant heart with triumph swells,</div>
<div class="i3">When the red coral shakes its silver bells;</div>
<div class="i3">She, like young statesmen, when the rattle rings,</div>
<div class="i3">Leaps at the sound, and struts in leading strings.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Next, little Miss, in pinafore so trim,</div>
<div class="i3">With nurse so noisy, and mamma so prim;</div>
<div class="i3">Eager to tell you all she has learned to utter,</div>
<div class="i3">Lisps as she grasps the allotted bread and butter;</div>
<div class="i3">Type of her sex, who, though no longer young,</div>
<div class="i3">Holds everything with ease&mdash;except her tongue!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">A Schoolgirl then, she curls her hair in papers,</div>
<div class="i3">And mimics father’s gout, and mother’s vapours;</div>
<div class="i3">Tramples alike on customs and on toes,</div>
<div class="i3">And whispers all she hears to all she knows:</div>
<div class="i3">“Betty” (she cries), “it comes into my head,</div>
<div class="i3">Old maids grow cross, because their cats are dead;</div>
<div class="i3">My governess has been in such a fuss</div>
<div class="i3">About the death of her old tabby puss;</div>
<div class="i3">She wears black stockings! Ha! ha! what a pother</div>
<div class="i3">’Cause one old cat’s in mourning for another!”</div>
<div class="i3">&mdash;The child of Nature, free from pride and pomp,</div>
<div class="i3">And sure to please, though nothing but a romp.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Next, riper Miss, who, nature more disclosing,</div>
<div class="i3">Now finds some traits of art are interposing;</div>
<div class="i3">And, with blue laughing eyes behind her fan,</div>
<div class="i3">First acts her part with that great actor&mdash;Man!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Behold her now&mdash;an ogling vain Coquette,</div>
<div class="i3">Catching male gudgeons in her silver net;</div>
<div class="i3">Whilst the fair forehead tresses, frizzled full,</div>
<div class="i3">Rival the tufted locks that grace the bull!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Then comes that sober character&mdash;the Wife,</div>
<div class="i3">With all the dear distracting cares of life;</div>
<div class="i3">A thousand cards a thousand joys extend,</div>
<div class="i3">For what may not upon a card depend?</div>
<div class="i3">Now she’ll snatch half a glance at opera, ball,</div>
<div class="i3">A meteor traced by none, though seen by all;</div>
<div class="i3">’Till “spousy” finds, while anxious to immure her,</div>
<div class="i3">A patent coffin only can secure her.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">At last the Dowager, in ancient flounces,</div>
<div class="i3">With snuff and spectacles, she folly trounces,</div>
<div class="i3">And, moralising, thus the age denounces:</div>
<div class="i3">“How bold and forward each young flirt appears!</div>
<div class="i3">Courtship, in my time, lasted seven years;</div>
<div class="i3">Now seven little months suffice, of course,</div>
<div class="i3">For courting, marrying, scolding, and divorce;</div>
<div class="i3">They say we have no souls; but what more odd is&mdash;</div>
<div class="i3">Nor men nor women now have any bodies!</div>
<a name="Page_171" id="Page_171"></a><span class="pageno">171</span>
<div class="i3">When I was young, my heart was always tender,</div>
<div class="i3">And would, to every spouse I had, surrender;</div>
<div class="i3">Their wishes to refuse, I never durst,</div>
<div class="i3">And my fourth died as happy as my first!”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i3">Truce to such splenetic and rash designs,</div>
<div class="i3">And let us mingle candour with our lines:</div>
<div class="i3">In all the stages of domestic life&mdash;</div>
<div class="i3">As child or sister, parent, friend, or <span class="lock">wife&mdash;</span></div>
<div class="i3">Woman, the source of every fond employ,</div>
<div class="i3">Softens affliction, and enlivens joy.</div>
<div class="i3">What is your boast, male rulers of the land?</div>
<div class="i3">How cold and cheerless all you can command!</div>
<div class="i3">Vain your ambition, vain your wealth and power,</div>
<div class="i3">Unless kind woman share the raptured hour;</div>
<div class="i3">Unless ’midst all the glare of pageant art,</div>
<div class="i3">She adds her smile, and triumphs in your heart!</div>

<div class="i1">To study in the school. Then, the Acolyte,</div>
<div class="i1">Sighing like furnace, with a woeful sonnet</div>
<div class="i1">Made to a dado. Then, the full-fledged Poet,</div>
<div class="i1">Full of strange whims, long-haired as Absalom,</div>
<div class="i1">Jealous of fame, profuse of attitude,</div>
<div class="i1">Seeking the bubble reputation</div>
<div class="i1">E’en at the tea-pot’s spout. Then, the Professor,</div>
<div class="i1">With bilious mien and clothes not wisely cut,</div>
<div class="i1">His monologues quite too idealised,</div>
<div class="i1">Bursting with Culture and the Infinite;</div>
<div class="i1">And so he plays his part. The sixth stage shifts</div>
<div class="i1">Into the lank and velvet-suited Humbug,</div>
<div class="i1">With nippers on his nose and tuft on chin;</div>
<div class="i1">His mystic style, well saved, a world too wide</div>
<div class="i1">For his shrunk audience; while his croaky voice,</div>
<div class="i1">Striving again to rouse to rapture, seems</div>
<div class="i1">But senseless in its sound. Last scene of all,</div>
<div class="i1">That ends this strange eventful history,</div>
<div class="i1">Is utter idiotcy and mere oblivion,</div>
<div class="i1">Sans mind, sans taste, sans Art, sans everything.</div>

<p>[This parody was quoted in “The Æsthetic Movement in
England” by Walter Hamilton (Third Edition, Reeves and
Turner, London 1882), in which work will be found full particulars
of the peculiar form of Art revival here satirised.
Though the cant of Æstheticism is fashionable no longer,
the good that was effected by the serious devotees of the
worship of Beauty and Culture is very visible in our domestic
architecture, our house decorations, furniture, and china, as
compared with the styles in vogue thirty years since.]</p>

which time the form of government in France was
nominally Republican, though very unsettled. King
Louis Philippe had been forced to abdicate in February,
1848, and a republic was proclaimed, of which Louis
Napoleon (afterwards Emperor) was elected President.
Around the Parody were seven illustrations, drawn by the

celebrated Richard Doyle, representing “Young France
mewling and puking in the Nurse’s arms;” “The
Ouvrier creeping like snail unwillingly to school;”
“Lamartine inditing a sonnet to Liberty’s Eyebrow;”
“The Garde Mobile seeking the Bubble reputation in the
Cannon’s mouth;” “The Justice with eyes severe,” a
portrait of General Cavaignac; and, last scene of all,
poor France with her feet in Hot Water, and Louis
Napoleon in the back ground carrying the fatal <cite>Idées
Napoliennes</cite>, which finally brought him, and his country,
to defeat and ruin.]</p>

<p>There are many other parodies of this speech.
One was contained in a burlesque operatic tragedy
performed at the Lyceum Theatre in July, 1812,
entitled “Highgate Tunnel, or the Secret Arch,”
of which the argument was that “All the world’s a
stable.” Unfortunately this play is not to be found
in the Library of the British Museum, consequently
the parody cannot be reproduced, but the following,
on the subject of <em>Carriages</em>, is of a somewhat
kindred nature. It is taken from <cite>The Sporting

<h4 class="h4head">THE MERCHANT OF VENICE.</h4>

<p class="center">&mdash;&mdash;<i>:o:</i>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>A burlesque of “The Merchant of Venice”
was produced at the Olympic Theatre, London, on
Monday July 4th, 1853. It was entitled “<cite>Shylock
or, the Merchant of Venice Preserved.</cite> An entirely
new reading of Shakespeare, from an edition hitherto
undiscovered by modern authorities, and which it
is hoped may be received as the stray leaves of a
<em>Jerusalem Hearty-Joke</em>.”</p>

<p>This burlesque was written by Mr. Francis
Talfourd with a special view to furnishing F. Robson,
with a character adapted to his peculiar abilities,
and <i>Shylock</i> suited him admirably.</p>

<p>There are however no distinct parodies of any
passages of the original which could be quoted
without making long extracts. This is unnecessary,
as the burlesque can be readily obtained from the
theatrical publishers.</p>

<p>So great was the success of “The Rejected
Addresses,” that many inferior imitations were
issued, amongst them being a small Volume, entitled
“Accepted Addresses” published by Thomas
Tegg. In it are poems jocularly ascribed to Lord
Byron, and Walter Scott, there is also a burlesque,
entitled “<cite>Macbeth Travestie</cite>, in three acts. With
Burlesque annotations, after the manner of Dr.
Johnson, G. Stevens, Esq., and the various Commentators.”
The author acknowledges that the
favorable reception which attended the Travestie
on <cite>Hamlet</cite>, by John Poole, gave him the suggestion
for the undertaking, to which it must be said, it is
much inferior. It contains no parodies of sufficient
interest or merit to be quoted.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>There was another “Macbeth Travestie” in two
acts, written by Francis Talfourd, and performed
at Henley-on-Thames, on the day of the regatta,
June 17, 1847. This was published by E. T.
Spiers, of High Street, Oxford, it was afterwards
produced, with slight alterations, at the Strand
Theatre, on January 10, 1848; and again at the
Olympic Theatre, on April 25, 1853, when the
part of Macbeth was performed by F. Robson.
The London Edition (published by Lacy) has a
humourous preface by William Farren. The Incantation
Scene (scene <abbr title="four">IV.</abbr>, act <abbr title="two">II.</abbr>) commences

<p><cite>The Royal Dramatic College Annual</cite>, for July,
1868, contains an imaginary dialogue between
Othello (Lord Dundreary) and Iago (Mr. Buckstone),
written by Mr. T. F. Dillon-Croker. It is
very amusing, but it is not strictly a parody.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">William <abbr title="four">IV.</abbr> and Reform.</span></p>

<p>When the great Reform Bill was thrown out by
the Lords on May 7, 1832, the Ministry resigned,
and the country was on the verge of Revolution.
King William <abbr title="four">IV.</abbr> who had hitherto been bitterly
opposed to any Reforms, now induced the Ministers
to resume office by reluctantly granting to
Earl Grey full power to secure majorities, by the
creation of new Peers. Henry, Lord Brougham,
was then Lord Chancellor. The following parody
appeared in <cite>Figaro in London</cite>, illustrated with
portraits of the Puppet King (“Silly-Billy” he was
styled), Earl Grey, and Lord Brougham.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="center"><span class="lowercase sc">THE ROYAL PUPPET.</span></p>

<p class="blockquote">“Here is a representation of a puppet, the movements
of which are occasioned by certain strings, which are held
in the hands of persons who amuse themselves by pulling
first one and then the other according as it may serve their
temporary purposes. The funny little figure wriggles
about first to one side and then the other just as it strikes
the whim of those in whose hands he happens to be, and
he is forced when acted on by them to play whatever
antics they may deem desirable. One jerk may make the
little fellow extend his hand in an attitude of friendship,
while the next moment he may be made grotesquely to
throw up his foot, as if he would kick down the very thing
to which he had the moment before offered his hand, and
thus he wriggles about in every sense of the word, the
mere <em>puppet</em> of those who possess the power to play upon
him. Occasionally the funny little figure is made to take
part in a scenic representation, and here we give to our
readers a specimen of certain interesting</p>

<p class="center"><span class="lowercase sc">STATE THEATRICALS.</span></p>

<p class="blockquote">The subject is chosen from Shakespeare’s Othello, and
the following is the cast of the principal characters.”</p>

<p class="center small"><span class="sc">Desdemona</span>, by <i>Hibernia, the Sister Country</i>.</p>

<p class="blockquote">It would be needless and somewhat tedious to print the
whole of the well-known tragedy,&mdash;showing how Desdemona
was wronged, and Othello degraded, by the cunning
of Iago.</p>

<p class="blockquote">For <i>Iago</i> and <i>Othello</i> we shall for the sake of verisimilitude

<p>“Othello Travestie, an operatic Burlesque
Burletta,” by Maurice G. Dowling, Esq., was first
produced at the Liver Theatre, Liverpool, March,
1834, and was afterwards performed at the Strand
Theatre, London.</p>

<p>This now reads as a very dull and stupid burlesque,
in which the only approach at fun is obtained
from causing Othello to speak, and act, like a negro
melodist. The songs introduced are mostly founded
on the Ethiopian melodies then popular, and there
are no passages, of any merit, parodying the original
tragedy.</p>

<p>This burlesque can still be obtained from Mr.
Samuel French, 89, Strand, London.</p>

<p>There was a much earlier “Othello Travestie,”
published in 1813, of which details are wanting.</p>

<p>In 1879 a Mr. Tracy Turnerelli acquired a certain
notoriety in consequence of having organized
a subscription to purchase a golden laurel wreath
to be presented to Lord Beaconsfield. The subscription
was entitled “The People’s Tribute,”
and 52800 pennies were collected, the wreath was
made and publicly exhibited, when, to the great
disgust of Mr. Tracy Turnerelli, the Prime
Minister declined the gift. Lord Beaconsfield’s
reasons were given in the following letter, which
cleverly exposes the self-seeking motives of the
organiser of this “Tribute”:<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="blockquote">
“10, Downing-street, Whitehall, June 16, 1879.&mdash;Sir,&mdash;Lord
Beaconsfield desires me to inform you that he has
received and carefully considered your letter of the 8th
inst., in which you ask him to name a day for the presentation
of a laurel wreath procured by the contributions of
upwards of 50,000 of the people, which have been collected,
<a name="Page_189" id="Page_189"></a><span class="pageno">189</span>
according to your statement, with ‘immense labour and
never-yet-exampled efforts.’ His lordship has, moreover,
had before him the correspondence which during the last
five years you have addressed to him, and he notices
especially your complaints that your services have received
no recognition at the hands of the leaders of the Conservative
party, and the expression of your hope that ‘sooner
or later they will meet with reward.’ Although Lord
Beaconsfield would fully appreciate and value a spontaneous
gift from his fellow-subjects belonging to a class in
which he has ever taken the warmest interest, he cannot
but feel that, being himself intimately connected with
honours and rewards, he is precluded by the spirit in
which you have previously addressed him from accepting
a gift thus originated, and proffered in a manner which he
cannot deem satisfactory.&mdash;I have the honour to be, sir,
your obedient servant, <span class="sc">Algernon Turnor</span>.</p>

<p class="blockquote">Tracy Turnerelli, Esq.”</p>

<p>The golden wreath was publicly exhibited at the
Crystal Palace, and afterwards at Madame Tussaud’s
Exhibition.</p>

against Cæsar, this is my answer:&mdash;Not that I
loved Cæsar less, but that I loved Rome more.
Had you rather Cæsar were living and die all
slaves, than that Cæsar were dead, to live all free
men? As Cæsar loved me, I weep for him; as
he was fortunate, I rejoice at it; as he was
valiant I honour him; but, as he was ambitious,
I slew him. There is tears for his love; joy for
his fortune; honour for his valour; and death for
his ambition. Who is here so base that would
be a bondman? If any, speak; for him have I
offended. Who is here so rude that would not
be a Roman? If any, speak; for him have I
offended. Who is here so vile that will not love

I slew him. There are tears for his beauty; honour for
his condition; joy for his speed; and death for his toothsomeness.
Who is here so cruel would see a starved
man? If any, speak, for him have I offended. Who is
here so silly that would not take a tit-bit? If any, speak,
for him have I offended. Who is here so sleek that does
not love his belly? If any, speak, for him have I
offended.”</p>

<p class="blockquote">“You have offended justice, sirrah,” cried one of the
magistrates, out of all patience at this long and strange
harangue.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Then,” cried the culprit, guessing at the hungry feelings
of the bench, “since justice is dissatisfied, it must
needs have something to devour; heaven forbid I should
keep any gentleman from his dinner&mdash;so, if you please, I’ll
wish your worships a good day, and a good appetite.”</p>

<div class="i1">The number being <em>seven</em>&mdash;First the Poet,</div>
<div class="i1">Fond of the jingling line and tinsel smile,</div>
<div class="i1">Enjoying tortur’d sense and strangling art,</div>
<div class="i1">But if the line flows smoothly to its end,</div>
<div class="i1">For ever bathing in the Aonean font;</div>
<div class="i1">Him nought but sonnets, stanzas, odes, delight,</div>
<div class="i1">And so he reads his part. Next comes in view</div>
<div class="i1">The sober, softly-sighing Sentimentalist,</div>
<div class="i1">Seeking for rapture in the&mdash;dashy&mdash;line,</div>
<div class="i1">The Shandean tale, ill told compar’d with Sterne’s,</div>
<div class="i1">They fragments choose, and tales and anecdotes.</div>
<div class="i1">Next the Wit, relishing the fun obscene</div>
<div class="i1">If but the point be gross&mdash;Him repartees,</div>
<div class="i1">Bon mots and gummy epigrams must please.</div>
<div class="i1">And then the Politician, full of strange whims;</div>
<div class="i1">Seeking essays, strictures, observations,</div>
<div class="i1">With solemn phiz, talking of revolutions,</div>
<div class="i1">Patriot armies, sieges, and leagues of despots;</div>
<div class="i1">Of neutral powers and of neutral rights, cabals,</div>
<div class="i1">Of foreign interference, suability of states,</div>
<div class="i1">And all the mazes of the court police.</div>
<div class="i1">He marks each signature&mdash;what Brutus writes he reads,</div>
<div class="i1">And turns his eye from Cassius&mdash;sees in some men</div>
<div class="i1">The wish to bond us to a foreign yoke;</div>
<div class="i1">In others, sees the wish for nature’s state,</div>
<div class="i1">And have the curbed bit of law destroy’d,</div>
<div class="i1">That like the savage all might rove at will,</div>
<div class="i1">Free as the air they breathe; while some he sees,</div>
<div class="i1">Who wish the government of purest source</div>
<div class="i1">And subordination, might secure</div>
<div class="i1">Our fair inheritance&mdash;These form the general mass.</div>
<div class="i1">Next comes the Economist, hunting for recipes,</div>
<div class="i1">Receipts, experiments.&mdash;With up turn’d nose</div>
<div class="i1">He runs o’er prose and verse, and like to Hotspur</div>
<div class="i1">Had rather be a Kitten and cry mew</div>
<div class="i1">Than, one of these same metre ballad loves.</div>
<div class="i1">The grade of Moralist next advance to view!</div>
<div class="i1">Fond of the maxim sage, and sober precept:</div>
<div class="i1">They once a week expect their frugal fare,</div>
<div class="i1">To mend the manners and instruct the mind,</div>
<div class="i1">Last comes the pale and slipper’d Wonder Hunter,</div>
<div class="i1">Intent on dying speeches,&mdash;hurricanes,</div>
<div class="i1">Malignant fevers, pestilence and want.&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Of thousands butcher’d on the bloody field,</div>
<div class="i1">And thousands starving in the wasted land,</div>
<div class="i1">They thunder storms delight in, and seek</div>
<div class="i1">With earnest eye for deaths and murders,</div>
<div class="i1">Of people drown’d, or burnt, or suffocated,</div>
<div class="i1">Learn whom the Knot of Hymen has fast tied,</div>
<div class="i1">And whom the Knot of Justice faster noos’d;</div>
<div class="i1">With the long list of every human ill.</div>
<div class="i1">These all must have their part. The printer, else,</div>
<div class="i1">Is but the standing mark of censure loud,</div>
<div class="i1">These tastes <em>not</em> gratified, they will all growl,</div>
<div class="i1">And cry the papers barren, empty, dull,</div>
<div class="i1">Sans news, sans sense, sans art, sans everything.</div>

<div class="i1">“All the world’s a stage” in several stages;</div>
<div class="i1">Great Shakespeare says our acts are seven ages,</div>
<div class="i1">“And all the men and women players merely.”</div>
<div class="i1">See “As you like it,” which informs us clearly</div>
<div class="i1">We have our entrances and exits here,</div>
<div class="i1">And many of us no great shakes appear.</div>
<div class="i1">“King John,” “Macbeth,” and others of his plays,</div>
<div class="i1">Confirm our wickedness in many ways;</div>
<div class="i1">First, the Infant in its nurse’s arms, it</div>
<div class="i1">“Mewles and pukes,” and as it cries she calms it.</div>
<div class="i1">Next there’s the Schoolboy constantly declining</div>
<div class="i1">The verb “to work,” and with his satchel whining,</div>
<div class="i1">As on he creeps, like snail, at <em>slug</em>-gard’s pace&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">A <em>sun</em> not always “with a shining face:”</div>
<div class="i1">Until he learns ’tis easier to be good,</div>
<div class="i1">His master being in th’ imperative mood;</div>
<div class="i1">And if the youth is backward in the school,</div>
<div class="i1">He has his knuckles reddened with the rule.</div>
<div class="i1">The rule of three he does not deem much fun,</div>
<div class="i1">While he is flinching at the rule of one,</div>
<div class="i1">Who makes him only ten times more perplexed;</div>
<div class="i1">The lover, <i>à la</i> Vilikin comes next,</div>
<div class="i1">And who, like Vilikin, trolls out a ballad</div>
<div class="i1">As neatly garnished as a lobster salad;</div>
<div class="i1">“Made to his mistress’ eyebrow;” to some air,</div>
<div class="i1">Which howsome’er she says she cannot bear.</div>
<div class="i1">Sometimes this age betokens noisy gent</div>
<div class="i1">Not coming home till midnight is far spent</div>
<div class="i1">Who cannot from the knockers quite abstain,</div>
<div class="i1">Of which the quiet inmates will complain.</div>
<div class="i1">Sometimes these fast young men after the play,</div>
<div class="i1">At Cyder Cellars turn night into day,</div>
<div class="i1">This they call “Killing time,” until they learn</div>
<div class="i1">Old Time may, perhaps the compliment return.</div>
<div class="i1">Then come the Soldiers and the <span class="lock">Volunteers&mdash;</span></div>
<div class="i1">In other words the prime of life appears&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Full of strange oaths, and bearded like the pard,</div>
<div class="i1">Jealous in honour, zealous when on guard;</div>
<div class="i1">Seeking without the least intimidation,</div>
<div class="i1">What Shakespeare calls “the bubble reputation.”</div>
<div class="i1">’Tis strange they are not <em>bored</em> with so much <em>drilling</em>,</div>
<div class="i1">While practising the noble art of killing!</div>
<div class="i1">Next is the Justice, and he just is fat,</div>
<div class="i1">Living on law&mdash;not always justice that!</div>
<div class="i1">Proving beyond all doubt, by frequent panting,</div>
<a name="Page_196" id="Page_196"></a><span class="pageno">196</span>
<div class="i1">The law he lives on is not that of Banting;</div>
<div class="i1">His body (outside) like a water butt</div>
<div class="i1">But not within! His beard of formal cut,</div>
<div class="i1">Full of wise saws (such as are seldom seen</div>
<div class="i1">Excepting at a carpenter’s I ween)</div>
<div class="i1">And modern instances; and so he plays</div>
<div class="i1">His part, until he sees declining days</div>
<div class="i1">Announce another age, when enters soon</div>
<div class="i1">The sixth, “the lean and slippered Pantaloon,”</div>
<div class="i1">“With spectacles on nose, and pouch on side,</div>
<div class="i1">“His youthful hose well saved, a world too wide</div>
<div class="i1">“For his shrunk shank;” his voice begins to fail,</div>
<div class="i1">And whistles up and down the vocal scale.</div>
<div class="i1">Last scene of all this history that ends,</div>
<div class="i1">Is mere oblivion of those trusty friends</div>
<div class="i1">Who gather round us, and who thus endeavour</div>
<div class="i1">To cheer and comfort ’ere we leave for ever</div>
<div class="i1">This busy, meddling, moneymaking world;</div>
<div class="i1">Sans teeth, as into it we once were hurled</div>
<div class="i1">Indeed, for time can no more changes ring,</div>
<div class="i1">“Sans sight, sans taste, sans smell, sans everything,</div>
<div class="i1">And so the curtain falls, thus ends the play</div>
<div class="i1">Which might be named “Bud, Blossom and Decay”!</div>
<div class="i1">The time is short between each act, and we</div>
<div class="i1">Should note the changes, and our errors see</div>
<div class="i1">And thus a wholesome lesson may be gained,</div>
<div class="i1">The proper sentiment being yet retained</div>
<div class="i1">Without a jest against the reader’s will,</div>
<div class="i1">Though slightly altered, “As you like it” still.</div>

<div class="i1">“All the world is but a stage,” Shakespeare told us long ago,</div>
<div class="i1">Had he graced the present age, still the Bard had found it so;</div>
<div class="i1">All that from existence springs, in a theatre’s compass lies,</div>
<div class="i1">Happy moments find the “wings” time itself takes those and “flies,”</div>
<div class="i1">Hopes that light us on the way may be called of life “the floats,”</div>
<div class="i1">Turning gloomy night to day, as the prompter Fate denotes;</div>
<div class="i1">Fortune gives the glare of gas, and oft causing sad mishaps,</div>
<div class="i1">With unsteady hand, alas! speculation work “the traps,”</div>
<div class="i1">Fate gives out the parts to play, various “lengths” assigned to each,</div>
<div class="i1">Happy who their “tag” can say, in a good concluding speech;</div>
<div class="i1">Every act applause will get, if the action be correct,</div>
<div class="i1">Ending with a kind of “set” most productive of effect.</div>
<div class="i1">Suppers should take place in both&mdash;cheering signs of lively chats;</div>
<div class="i1">Some too often show “a cloth” closed in by a “pair of flats.”</div>
<div class="i1">Help our brethren, worn with age&mdash;Shakespeare was of truth a sayer</div>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Scene</span>,&mdash;<i>The Marquis of Salisbury’s House, Arlington Street</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Northcote.</span> Are we all met?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Salisbury.</span> Pat, pat; and this is a marvellous convenient
place for our rehearsal. This stuffed settee shall be
our Speaker’s chair, these tongs the Mace, and we will
do it in action as we will do it before the House.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Northcote.</span> Salisbury&mdash;<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="sc">Salisbury.</span> What say’st thou, bully Stafford?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Northcote.</span> There are things in this comedy of <cite>Jingo
and Whisky</cite> that will never please. First, Jingo must draw
his sword, which Radicals can never abide.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Lord John Manners.</span> By’r lakin, a parlous fear.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Hicks-Beach.</span> I believe we must leave the killing out
when all is done.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Salisbury.</span> Not a whit. I have a desire to make all
well. Write me a prologue, and let the prologue seem to
say we will do no harm with our swords, and for the more
better assurance tell them that I, Jingo the Foreign Secretary,
am not Jingo, but Salisbury, who barks more than he
bites. This will put them out of fear.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Giffard.</span> Well, we shall have such a prologue, and it
shall be written for six and eight.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Lord John Manners.</span> Will not the ladies be afeard of
the tea tax?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Sir R. Cross.</span> I fear it, I promise you.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Northcote.</span> Masters, you ought to consider with yourselves.
To bring in&mdash;God shield us!&mdash;a tea tax among
ladies, is a dreadful thing, for there is not a more fearful
wild fowl living than your tea tax, and we ought to look to
it.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Lord John Manners.</span> Therefore another prologue
must tell he is not a tax.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Northcote.</span> Nay, you must name his name, and half
his face must be seen in the teapot, and he himself must
speak, saying thus, or to the same defect: “Ladies, or fair
ladies, I would wish you, or I would request you, or I
would entreat you, not to fear, not to tremble. If you
think I have come hither as a tax, it were pity of my life;
no, I am no such thing; I am an indirect impost, as
others are”&mdash;and there, indeed, let him name his name,
and tell them plainly he is Hicks-Beach, the member
for Gloucestershire.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Salisbury.</span> Well, it shall be so. But there is two hard
things; that is to bring Coercion into Ireland.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Hicks-Beach.</span> Have we a majority that night we play
our play?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Salisbury.</span> ’Tis doubtful. One must come in with a
rifle and a Bobby’s lantern, and say he comes to disfigure,
or to present, the person of Coercion. Then there is
another thing; we must have a Protection Bill in the
great Chamber.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Hicks-Beach.</span> You can never bring in Protection
What say you, Northcote?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Northcote.</span> Some man or other&mdash;Lowther, say&mdash;must
present Protection; and let him have some false statistics
to signify its benefits. Or let him hold his finger to his
nose, and through that sign let “buncombe” thus be
known.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Salisbury.</span> If that may be, then all is well. Come
sit down, every mother’s son, and rehearse your parts.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Salisbury.</span> Marry, our play is the most lamentable
comedy and laughable tragedy&mdash;<cite>A Conservative Government</cite>.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Churchill.</span> A very good piece of work, I assure you,
and a merry. Now, good Salisbury, call forth your
actors by the scroll. Masters, spread yourselves.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Salisbury.</span> Answer as I call you: Randolph Churchill,
the “Woodstock Wonder” and “Champion of the

Secretary for India.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Churchill.</span> What is Secretary for India?&mdash;a statesman
or a fool?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Salisbury.</span> A statesman that spends himself most
loyally for the State.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Churchill.</span> That will require some brains in the true
performance of it. If I do it, let the country look to’t.
I will move storms; I will be wise in <em>some</em> measure. To
the rest&mdash;Yet my chief humour is for a fool. I could
play a fool rarely, or a part to tear a cat in, to make all
split.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h4 class="h4head">THE LIFE AND DEATH OF KING JOHN.</h4>

<p>As long ago as November, 1883, my valued
friend Mr. T. F. Dillon-Croker, hearing that I contemplated
publishing a collection of “Parodies and
Burlesques,” wrote a characteristic letter, generously
placing his accumulated stores of materials
at my disposal. How fully and frankly I have
availed myself of that kind offer may be judged
from the fact that scarcely a single part of “Parodies”
has appeared which has not contained one,
or more, contributions furnished by Mr. Dillon-Croker.</p>

<p>In the letter above-mentioned, he remarked:&mdash;“You
may not be aware that the late Mr. Gilbert
A’ Beckett wrote a burlesque on <cite>King John</cite> (with the
benefit of the Act,) 1837, so that irreverence in
this direction is no novelty. Hubert was acted by
Edward Wright, afterwards so popular at the
Adelphi, and who, though often inclined to be
coarse, made me as a boy laugh more than I have
ever done since, and Madame Sala (the mother of
the genial and accomplished G. A. Sala,) was Lady
Constance.</p>

<p>Faulconbridge remarks:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="i1">We are two brothers of the same Mama,</div>
<div class="i1">But there are reasons for suspecting rather,</div>
<div class="i1">By some mistake there was an extra father.</div>
</div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end container-->

<p>Arthur, instead of losing his eyes, is condemned to
have a tooth out, and Hubert enters with a large
pair of pinchers:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="i1">“And you’ll take out my tooth&mdash;If you will, come,</div>
<div class="i1">I’ll not resist, here is my tooth by gum!”</div>
</div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end container-->

<p>This, at the present day sounds very insipid, if
not, irreverent fooling. A’ Beckett also turned Manfred
into a burlesque ballet opera in 1834. These
pieces were considered worth publishing, and are
curious, as shewing the style of composition that
amused an audience nearly 50 years ago.”</p>

<p>Following up the clue given in this letter, it
appears that this burlesque was first produced at
the St. James’s Theatre October 29, 1837, when
the cast was as follows:<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. Hall, who impersonated King John, wore a
chimney cowl as a helmet, surmounted by a
weather cock, of which the letters N. E. W. S.,
translated, burlesque fashion, became “Naughty
English Wrongful Sovereign.” Undoubtedly the
best scene in the burlesque is that which treats of
Hubert and Prince Arthur, the first scene of the
fourth act in the original. This approaches more
nearly to a parody of the language of Shakespeare,
than is usual in most burlesques of his tragedies.</p>

<p>In 1817 Samuel Taylor Coleridge wrote a
dramatic poem, entitled “<cite>Zapolya</cite>, a Christmas
Tale,” to which he prefixed the remark, “The form
<a name="Page_201" id="Page_201"></a><span class="pageno">201</span>
of the following dramatic poem is in humble imitation
of the Winter’s Tale of Shakespeare.”</p>

<p>Beyond the mere form, however, <cite>Zapolya</cite> has
little or no resemblance to Shakespeare’s play.</p>

<h4 class="h4head">ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA.</h4>

<p>On November 21, 1866, an Extravaganza, founded
on the above tragedy, was produced at the Haymarket
Theatre, London, then under the management
of Mr. J. B. Buckstone. This burlesque was
entitled “Antony and Cleopatra; or, His-tory and
Her-story in a modern nilo-metre,” by F. C. Burnand,
and the principal parts were played by Mr.
and Mrs. Charles Matthews, Mr. Compton, Mr.
Rogers, and Mr. Clark. The best parody it contained

was that of the well-known passage descriptive
of the meeting of Antony and Cleopatra on
the river of Cydnus, commencing thus:<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="i1">Burned on the water: the poop was beaten gold;</div>
<div class="i1">Purple the sails, and so perfumed that</div>
<div class="i1">The winds were love-sick with them; the oars were silver,</div>
<div class="i1">Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke, and made</div>
<div class="i1">The water which they beat to follow faster,</div>
<div class="i1">As amorous of their strokes. For her own person,</div>
<div class="i1">It beggar’d all description: she did lie</div>
<div class="i1">In her pavilion&mdash;cloth-of-gold of tissue&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">O’er-picturing that Venus where we see</div>
<div class="i1">The fancy outwork nature: on each side her</div>

<p>As a singular instance of the popularity of
Hamlet’s famous Soliloquy, it may be mentioned
that a Hebrew version of it was printed in 1880, in
<cite>Kottabos</cite>, a College journal published in Dublin.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Danish War.</span></p>

<p class="center">(<i>From our own Correspondent.</i>)</p>

<p class="quotesig small">Elsinore, May 20, 1848.</p>

<p class="blockquote">The army under General Fortinbras remains inactive.
The Crown Prince Hamlet has been appointed to the command,
but he is in a state of doubt as to whether he ought to

accept it. A good many intrigues are believed to exist at
the Danish Court, and two noblemen named Rosencrantz
and Guildenstern are suspected of being employed on a
delicate and dangerous mission. Gertrude, the Queen, does
not appear to enjoy good health, and rumours are rife of
violent scenes between her and Hamlet. The death of the
late Lord Chamberlain does not seem to have been at all
satisfactorily accounted for; and the consequent derangement
of his daughter, who it appears has been going about
singing very improper songs, has occasioned a great deal of
scandal. The King, however, swills his draught of Rhenish
down as usual, and even had some private theatricals lately.
The monarch, however, could not sit out the first piece, and
no wonder, for <i>entre nous</i> being legitimate it was awfully
slow. Meantime Hamlet’s conduct is quite unaccountable:
some people hint that he is mad; and the fact of his having
got up a cock-and-bull story of a ghost, which he says is
always walking about with a certain <span class="sc">Marshall Stalk</span>,
supposed to be a Prussian from the name, would seem to
countenance the theory. For my own part, whether he be
mad or no, I think his proceedings very stupid and tiresome.</p>

<h4 class="h4head">THE TEMPEST.</h4>

<p>“The Enchanted Isle; or Raising the Wind
on the most approved principles; a Drama without
the smallest claim to Legitimacy, Consistency,
Probability, or anything else but absurdity; in
which will be found much that is unaccountably
coincident with Shakespeare’s ‘<cite>Tempest</cite>.’” This
burlesque, written by the Brothers R. B. and W.
Brough, was first performed at the Adelphi Theatre,
London, on Monday, November 26, 1848. Beyond
the general foundation of the plot, it contains
no parodies of Shakespeare, but is full of allusions
to the political revolutions and events of 1848, and
has many parodies of songs which were then
popular, but which are now, for the most part,
obsolete. It was no doubt a very amusing burlesque,
having a good deal of lively music, songs,
and dances, and the cast was a powerful one,
including Paul Bedford, Miss Woolgar, Madame
Celeste, and O. Smith. It was afterwards revived
at the Haymarket Theatre, when Miss P. Horton,
Mrs. Fitzwilliam, Mr. Buckstone, Mr. Rogers, and
Mr. Clark performed the leading parts. The
following amusing parody of the Ghost-scene in
“Hamlet” was spoken as a</p>

<p>From this it will be seen that something in the
nature of an apology was deemed necessary for
this burlesque on “<cite>The Tempest</cite>,” and more recently
when Mr. Burnand produced his “<i>Ariel</i>,” there was
an angry discussion in the press, in which many
maintained that it was not in good taste, nor was
it advisable for the credit of our stage, that this
beautiful play (supposed to have been the last
written by Shakespeare), should be thus irreverently
treated. On <a href="#Page_144">page 144</a> of “Parodies” will be
found extracts from this correspondence. “<i>Ariel</i>”
was produced at the Gaiety Theatre, in October,
1883, and though a very harmless burlesque in
itself, and in far better taste than the Broughs,
“<cite>Enchanted Isle</cite>,” it was received with many signs of
disapprobation, and had but a short run. There
was nothing very original, nor very comical, in the
conception of Prospero as a magician, entirely
dependent upon his conjuring apparatus
without which he was absolutely powerless, whilst
as to the plot, it was that of the “<cite>Tempest</cite>” with
modern variations cut to a comic pattern, and
represented by a clever company, among whom
were Miss Phyllis Broughton as Ferdinand, Miss
Farren as Ariel, Miss Harcourt as the Captain, Mr.
Wyatt as Sebastian, and Mr. Elton as Caliban.
The burlesque teemed with popular allusions, and
the Fisheries Exhibition, naturally, was not in high
favour; there were some lively songs, and, of
course, plenty of dances for Miss E. Farren, and
Miss Connie Gilchrist.</p>

This little volume of 88 pages contains the supposed

<p class="center">&mdash;&mdash;<i>:o:</i>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><cite>Coriolanus Travestie</cite>, by J. Morgan, was produced
in Liverpool in 1846, and a burlesque of
King Lear, entitled, <cite>King Queer and his Daughters
Three</cite>, was played at the Strand Theatre, London,
in 1855. It will therefore be seen that travesties
have been written upon nearly every one of
William Shakespeare’s Tragedies, and that not even
his comedies, or historical plays, have quite escaped
burlesque. The enumeration here given is probably
incomplete, as many burlesques which have been
produced in provincial towns, and some which have
been played in London, enjoyed too short a run to
obtain the advantage of being printed.</p>

<p>Before closing this chapter on the burlesques of
Shakespeare, the following remarks on the subject
which appeared in <cite>The Daily News</cite>, of October
25, 1884, may be quoted:<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="blockquote">Few more striking proofs could be given of the great
and growing popularity of the theatre than the most
recent fluctuations of stage humour. The experience of
the present thus far confirms the judgment formed during
the two preceding seasons, that the comic element in stage
representation has undergone an important mutation both
in motive and in method. Fun is aimed at, and probably
achieved, as frequently as of yore; but the kind of fun
and the means employed to produce it are entirely
different, and possible only under the new conditions of
the theatre. Only a few years ago, when London had
comparatively few theatres, and supported, after a fashion,
two opera-houses, the theatrical world filled a ludicrously
small space in English life.</p>

<p class="blockquote">Only when the public are so keenly interested in the
dramatic world as they are at present could success attend
the profuse introduction of personal parody or caricature
into the lightest of stage plays. It would be poor
fun to present an elaborate caricature of a serious
actor to a spectator who knew little, and cared less
about him, and probably had not seen him in the
part more especially selected for ridicule. Recent burlesque
or travesty depends almost entirely for success
upon such caricature, and assumes perfect knowledge of
all the mannerisms of prominent actors and actresses.
The art of inverting a noble story so that it may appear
grotesque occupies quite a secondary position in the category
of effects. It would not, for instance, be considered
funny at this present juncture to travesty the Venetian
Senate into policemen drinking pots of porter, and Othello
himself into a negro, with plantation songs, dances and
accent. Nor would it be thought amusing to dress Shylock
with three hats upon his head, and make him in the
intervals of the Trial Scene try to sell cigars to the young
Venetians present in court. Yet this is precisely what
<a name="Page_206" id="Page_206"></a><span class="pageno">206</span>
Frank Talfourd, the great master of the word torturing
school, and the inventor of the agglutinate system of
punning, did. Henry J. Byron, too, made perhaps his
greatest burlesque hit in <cite>The Lady of Lyons</cite> by making up
Beauseant as Napoleon <abbr title="three">III.</abbr> and Claude Melnotte as
Napoleon <abbr title="one">I.</abbr> Again, Talfourd in <cite>The Merchant of Venice
Preserved</cite> wrote amazingly funny dialogue and songs for
Robson, but depended in no kind of way upon imitations
of Charles Kean and Phelps, which Robson could have
done to perfection. What would now be required in
<cite>Othello</cite> would be a low-comedy imitation of Signor Salvini
with an Iago made up like Mr. Irving, and a Desdemona
who could at least give a general impression of Miss
Ellen Terry. We are not propounding that the words
should be witless and senseless, all that we maintain is
that the caricaturists would in theatrical parlance “get
all the laughs.” An instance in point is that the song of
the hermit in <cite>Paw Clawdian</cite> neatly written by Mr.
Burnand, and capitally sung by Mr. E. D. Ward, although
received with hearty merriment, by no means threw the
audience into the convulsions provoked by Mr. Toole’s
appearance as Mr. Wilson Barrett. It is not the perversion
of motive and character, not the curious piling of

pun upon pun, which makes the success of modern
travesty. What is looked for is a clever presentment of
the surface peculiarities of the serious artist, such as those
of the Misses Linden in <cite>Silver Guilt</cite>, <cite>Stage Dora</cite>, and <cite>Paw
Clawdian</cite>, in which by turns Miss Eastlake, Madame
Sarah Bernhardt, and Mrs. Bernard Beere were parodied
with exceeding cleverness. It is only a few nights since
Miss Farren “brought down the house” by her brilliant
caricature of Mr. Kyrle Bellew, as Gilbert Vaughan in
<cite>Called Back</cite>.</p>

<p class="blockquote">The amusement to be obtained from putting counterfeit
presentments of statesmen, lawyers, and soldiers upon the
stage has been forbidden in theatres properly so-called,
and is only endured in music-halls in a modified shape.
Plenty of fun in the worst possible taste could be produced
by this ancient expedient, but as public opinion and
police reasons forbid it, recourse is had to the device of
hoisting the histrion with his own petard. All the clever
devices of his own art, all his mysteries of “make-up,”
and his talent for characterization, are devoted to the
object, not of parodying either Shakespeare or Sardou,
but the aspect of their creations embodied by the foremost
artists at present on the stage.</p>

<p>With what singular persistency of purpose does that
diminutive and laborious creature, the Bee, turn to account
every minute of sunshine! The construction of her cell is
a marvel of insect architecture; and if you were to attempt to
spread wax with the same neatness and regularity, you would
no doubt fail in the most ignominious manner. At least, I
know <em>I</em> should; for I was only the other day sealing a letter
when I burned my fingers dreadfully. I am aware that
bee’s-wax is not sealing-wax; but still if I had used bee’s-wax
to fasten my envelope, I daresay I should have made just
as bad a mess of it, or worse. Then again, look how the
Bee labours to store those octagonal chambers with the
saccharine food she is all the day gathering from roses,
tulips, candytuft, pelargoniums, pansies, pinks, hollyhocks,
fuchsias, heliotropes, marigolds, dahlias, begonias, lupines,
lilies, daffydowndillies, and, in short, every opening flower.
I can’t help thinking that if the whole of one’s time was
passed in books or work, or even healthy athletic pastimes,
such, for example, as hop-scotch, dominoes, tossing the
caber, knurr and spell, coddams, cricket, rounders, peg-top,
prisoner’s-base, noughts-and-crosses, Aunt Sally, cribbage,
nine-pins, Indian clubs, fly-the-garter, boxing, balancing
tobacco-pipes on the tip of one’s nose, skimming half-pence
at cats or attic windows, turning Catharine wheels in the
road, or putting the stone, we might haply give as good an
account of every day as our little friend the Bee could do, if so
required. (Since the foregoing was committed to manuscript,
I have met with some similar ideas in verse, by a Dr.
What’s-his-name. I do not, however, think it necessary or
desirable to cancel my own original reflections on a subject
which, after all, is quite open to anybody.)</p>

<p class="center">THE VARIATION HUMBUG.</p>

<p>There is perhaps more Humbug talked, printed,
and practised in reference to Music than to anything
else in the world, except Politics. And of all the
musical humbugs extant it occurs to <em>Mr. Punch</em> that the
Variation Humbug is the greatest. This party has not
even the sense to invent a tune for himself, but takes
somebody else’s, and starting therefrom as an acrobat
leaps from a spring board, jumps himself into a musical
reputation on the strength of the other party’s ideas.
<em>Mr. Punch</em> wonders what would be thought of a poet who
should try to make himself renown by this kind of thing&mdash;taking
a well-known poem of a predecessor’s, and doing
Variations on it after this fashion:<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>There! Would a Poet get much reputation for these
Variations, which are much better in their way than most
of those built upon tunes. Would the poetical critics
come out, as the musical critics do, with “Upon <span class="sc">Watts’s</span>
marble foundation <span class="sc">Buggins</span> has raised a sparkling
alabaster palace;” or, “The old-fashioned <span class="sc">Watts</span>
has been brought into new honour by the <i>étincellant</i>
<span class="sc">Buggins</span>;” or “We love the old tune, but we have
room in our hearts for the fairy-like fountains of birdsong
which <span class="sc">Buggins</span> has bid start from it.” <em>Mr. Punch</em>
has an idea that <span class="sc">Buggins</span> would have no such luck; the
moral to be deduced from which fact is, that a Musical
Prig is luckier than a Poetical Prig.</p>

<div class="i1">’Tis the voice of the rinker, I heard her complain,</div>
<div class="i2">You have stopped me too soon, I’ll go skating again,</div>
<div class="i1">As the door on its hinges, so she on her skates,</div>
<div class="i2">Turns gracefully, and expectantly waits.</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">A little more skating, a little more rinking,</div>
<div class="i2">Thus she wastes half her days, and her hours without thinking</div>
<div class="i1">And when she’s at home, she but lolls in a chair,</div>
<div class="i2">And wonders how soon she again will go there.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">On her way to the rink I once chanced to be nigh her,</div>
<div class="i2">And I thought that she held her head higher and higher,</div>
<div class="i1">So fine was the dress she wore, I quite shuddered to think</div>
<div class="i2">Of the money she wastes on the terrible rink.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">I made her a visit, still hoping to find</div>
<div class="i2">She took some little care for improving her mind;</div>
<div class="i1">She told me her feats, talked of dressing and rinking,</div>
<div class="i2">But scarce reads a book, and never loves thinking.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Then I said to myself, “Here’s a lesson to me,</div>
<div class="i2">This woman’s a pattern of what I might be,”</div>
<div class="i1">But I’m proud to confess, and I can without blinking,</div>
<div class="i2">I much prefer reading and writing to rinking.</div>

<p>This parody was ascribed to the pen of one
Stephen Bills, a convict, and some twenty years
ago his photograph could be obtained, with the
parody printed at the back. Mr. Bills was there
represented in the costume peculiar to gentlemen
who are enjoying state hospitality. It is a curious
circumstance that a very similar parody was included
in the volume entitled “Wit and humour,
<a name="Page_215" id="Page_215"></a><span class="pageno">215</span>
by Shirley Brooks,” edited by his son, and published
by Bradbury, Agnew &amp; <abbr title="Company">Co.</abbr>, London.</p>

<p>It would be interesting to know whether Mr.
Shirley Brooks was the actual author, or whether
he obtained the poem in the manner stated
below:</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Song by a Caged Bird.</span></p>

<p class="hanging">The following lines were found in the cell of a discharged
convict, who made his way into a Chaplain’s heart by
piety, and, subsequently, into a jeweller’s shop by burglary.</p>

<p>*.* The petty ambition of pretending to superior skill, in
other languages, seems pleasantly and aptly ridiculed in the
following anecdote:<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>One of our modern modishly-bred ladies, boasting of her
proficiency in the <span class="sc">French</span> tongue, asserted she understood and
spoke it better than she did English; and for the truth,
appealed to a French lady in company. The adroit Parisian
very candidly and sensibly replied, “I am not, my dear
madam, sufficiently acquainted with the English language
to determine; but I should be ashamed and sorry to say,
I spoke any language half so well as my own!”</p>

  <span class="sc">arodies</span> of Milton’s Poems are
neither numerous, nor particularly
amusing; the best known, and most
admired, is undoubtedly “The Splendid
Shilling,” written (in blank verse)
about 1700, by John Philips. A biography of this
author is included in Dr. Johnson’s “Lives of the
Poets.” He was born at Bampton in Oxfordshire,
on December 30, 1676. Being of a delicate constitution
his chief amusement was reading, and
as Milton was his favorite author, he chose his
style for a parody, whilst he found a subject in the
character of an impecunious college friend, who
knew not how to keep a shilling in his pocket.
“The Splendid Shilling” has one great charm,
rare in such works, it is a burlesque in which
nobody is ridiculed. John Philips died on
February 15, 1708, and was buried in Hereford
Cathedral. There is a tablet to his memory in
Poet’s Corner, Westminster Abbey, which chronicles

in high flown Latin phrases, his achievements in
poetry. Of these the principal were “Blenheim,”
and “Cider,” the latter being founded upon the
model of Virgil’s <cite>Georgics</cite>.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Sir Richard Steele</span>, in “The Tatler,”
pronounced “The Splendid Shilling” to be the
finest Burlesque Poem in the English language, and
<span class="sc">Dr. Johnson</span> praised it as an admirable imitation
of the stately movement of Milton’s blank verse,
whilst <span class="sc">Oliver Goldsmith</span>, in his Criticisms, says
“This is reckoned the best parody of Milton in our
language; it has been an hundred times imitated
without success.”</p>

<p>It is a pity that Dr. Goldsmith did not more
particularly describe these imitations, as after much
searching only about half a dozen have come to
light, all of them somewhat old fashioned in subject
and manner of treatment.</p>

<p>One of the best, written by Mr. Bramston
(author of The Man of Taste, The Art of Politics
etc.) was entitled <cite>The Crooked Sixpence</cite>, and may
be found occasionally in old books of Comic
Recitations, and Elegant Extracts. Unfortunately
no “Elegant Extracts” can be taken from it suitable
for the chaste pages of <cite>Parodies</cite>, for the poem
relates to such a topic as might have afforded excellent
material to Rabelais, or Chaucer, but which
cannot be alluded to in our more refined times.</p>

<p>A few years after the publication of <cite>The Splendid
Shilling</cite>, a small pamphlet appeared, entitled
“<span class="sc">Wine, a Poem</span>. To which is added, <em>Old</em> <span class="sc">England’s</span>
<cite>New Triumph; or, the Battle of</cite> <span class="sc">Audenard,
a Song</span>.” London: Printed and sold by H. Hills
in Black-fryars, near the Water-Side, 1709. No
author’s name is given; the poem certainly
deserves to be preserved, as an early and interesting
imitation of Milton’s blank verse. The song of
the “Battle of Audenard” is not a parody.</p>

<div class="i1">Happy the man who in his pot contains</div>
<div class="i1">A suet dumpling; he nor feels the pains</div>
<div class="i1">Of going dinnerless, nor griping hunger;</div>
<div class="i1">But cheerful blows the fire with merry heart,</div>
<div class="i1">Often revolving when the happy minute</div>
<div class="i1">That brings it to his homely board will come.</div>
<div class="i1">Sometimes with longing eyes he gazes hard,</div>
<div class="i1">And views it boiling in the frothy waves;</div>
<div class="i1">Then, with his fork or spoon applied, he feels,</div>
<div class="i1">And turns it o’er and o’er. Now time moves slowly on;</div>
<div class="i1">The hour-glass, which in yon old corner stands,</div>
<div class="i1">Is often view’d; for now his stomach keen,</div>
<div class="i1">Gnawing with greedy expectation,</div>
<div class="i1">Almost persuades him that the sands are stopp’d.</div>
<div class="i1">Now is his table placed near the fire,</div>
<div class="i1">His cloth of dingy hue is spread thereon;</div>
<div class="i1">His large clasp knife from out his pocket pull’d.</div>
<div class="i1">(A knife which oft has dealt destruction dire</div>
<div class="i1">To many a pudding, beef, or whate’er else</div>
<div class="i1">Came in its way; for none it spar’d;)</div>
<div class="i1">The earthen plate which graces his old shelf,</div>
<div class="i1">(Which late grimalkin, taking her nightly walks</div>
<div class="i1">In search of prey, by dire mishap</div>
<div class="i1">Threw down; but, by good care of fortune,</div>

<div class="i1">Is straight in order plac’d and all’s compleat.</div>
<div class="i1">As when the mariner, who, long from home,</div>
<div class="i1">Far from his native land, through seas and storms</div>
<div class="i1">And dangerous perils, homeward does return;</div>
<div class="i1">Sudden he sees the wish’d for port appear,</div>
<div class="i1">Joy fills his dancing heart, and now he feeds</div>
<div class="i1">His fancy with the pleasing expectation</div>
<div class="i1">Of mirth and joy, and heart delighting scenes.</div>
<div class="i1">Behold the pot has yielded up its store,</div>
<div class="i1">And reeking hot, is placed upon the plate!</div>
<div class="i1">The three-legg’d stool is drawn, and down he sits,</div>
<div class="i1">Elated with the goodly prospect: sudden</div>
<div class="i1">His knife, well plung’d, dreadful incision makes;</div>
<div class="i1">And fork, aptly applied, his joys compleat.</div>
<div class="i1">Now direful devastation does ensue;</div>
<div class="i1">And half the delicious morsel is destroy’d</div>
<div class="i1">Ere he can make a pause; which having done,</div>
<div class="i1">He smacks his lips, and liking well the sport,</div>
<div class="i1">Proceeds again with more deliberation,</div>
<div class="i1">Till of the luscious cates he’s made an end.</div>
<div class="i1">Thus happy he, envying not sumptuous feasts,</div>
<div class="i1">Nor courtly entertainments; but well pleas’d,</div>
<div class="i1">Feasts on his homely viands; far happier than a king,</div>
<div class="i1">He enjoys as full content, without his cares.</div>

<div class="i1">Attends my thoughts, and fills my gloomy mind</div>
<div class="i1">With tales of gliding sprites, in milk-white shrouds</div>
<div class="i1">Array’d, and rattling chains, and yelling ghosts</div>
<div class="i1">Irascible! or Fancy, mimic queen,</div>
<div class="i1">To swift imagination’s eye presents</div>
<div class="i1">A group of tiny elves, in circling dance,</div>
<div class="i1">Or luscious feast employ’d; such elves as danc’d</div>
<div class="i1">When Oberon did fair Titania wed;</div>
<div class="i1">While I, in wishes impotent and vain,</div>

<div class="i1">The tedious moments spend; or if, perchance,</div>
<div class="i1">Morpheus invok’d, my heavy eye-lids close,</div>
<div class="i1">Dear Liberty still haunts my sleeping thoughts,</div>
<div class="i1">And in a short-liv’d dream those joys I taste,</div>
<div class="i1">Which waking are denied; and beat the hoop</div>
<div class="i1">With dextrous hand, or run with feet as swift</div>
<div class="i1">As feather’d arrow flies from archer’s bow:</div>
<div class="i1">Till, from my slumber wak’d, too soon I find</div>
<div class="i1">It was illusion all, and mockery vain.</div>
<div class="i1">Thus, comfortless, appall’d, forlorn, I pass</div>
<div class="i1">The tardy hours, nor of those viands taste,</div>
<div class="i1">Which are on other boys full oft bestow’d</div>
<div class="i1">In plenteous manner, by the liberal hand</div>
<div class="i1">Of friend indulgent; apple-pye, or tart</div>
<div class="i1">Or trembling custard of delicious go˚t,</div>
<div class="i1">Or frothy syllabub in copious bowl.</div>
<div class="i1">Hard fate for me! Yet harder still betides</div>
<div class="i1">Me, hapless youth! My faithful top, that oft</div>
<div class="i1">Has cheer’d my drooping spirits, and reviv’d</div>
<div class="i1">My saddening thoughts, when o’er the pavement smooth</div>
<div class="i1">It spins, and sleeps, and to its master’s hand</div>
<div class="i1">Does ample justice, now, alas! become</div>
<div class="i1">To all the rude inclemencies of weather,</div>
<div class="i1">To time and destiny’s relentless doom</div>
<div class="i1">A miserable victim, quite decay’d</div>
<div class="i1">With many services, and cleft throughout</div>
<div class="i1">All useless lies; ah! sight of saddest woe</div>
<div class="i1">To wretched me! of every hope bereft,</div>
<div class="i1">Of every gleam of comfort. So the wretch,</div>
<div class="i1">Who near or Ætna or Vesuvius, dwells,</div>
<div class="i1">Beholds the sulphurous flames, the molten rocks,</div>
<div class="i1">And feels the ground trembling beneath his feet;</div>
<div class="i1">Till with a horrid yawn it opens wide</div>
<div class="i1">Before his eyes, all glaring with affright;</div>
<div class="i1">Swallows his cultur’d vines, his gardens, house,</div>
<div class="i1">With all his soul held dear, his lovely wife,</div>
<div class="i1">And prattling babes, the hopes of years to come;</div>
<div class="i1">All, all are lost, in ruin-terrible!</div>

<div class="i1">He shakes his sceptre, and th’ impending scourge</div>
<div class="i1">Brandishes high; nor tears nor shrieks avail;</div>
<div class="i1">But with impetuous fury it descends,</div>
<div class="i1">Imprinting horrid wounds with fatal flow</div>
<div class="i1">Of blood attended, and convulsive pangs.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Curst be the wretch, for ever doom’d to bear</div>
<div class="i1">Infernal whippings; he, whose savage hands</div>

<div class="i1">Of foul disgrace, and many a dolorous groan,</div>
<div class="i1">To hapless school-boy!&mdash;Could it not suffice</div>
<div class="i1">I groaned and toil’d beneath the merciless weight</div>
<div class="i1">By stern relentless tyranny impos’d;</div>
<div class="i1">But scourges too, and cudgels, were reserv’d</div>
<div class="i1">To goad my harrow’d sides: this wretched life</div>
<div class="i1">Loading with heavier ills! a life expos’d</div>
<div class="i1">To all the woes of hunger, toil, distress;</div>
<div class="i1">Cut off from every genial source of bliss;</div>
<div class="i1">From every bland amusement, wont to sooth</div>
<div class="i1">The youthful breast; except when father Time,</div>
<div class="i1">In joyful change, rolls round the festive hour,</div>
<div class="i1">That gives this meagre, pining figure back</div>
<div class="i1">To parent fondness, and its native roofs!</div>
<div class="i1">Fir’d with the thought, then, then, my towering son!</div>
<div class="i1">Rises superior to its load, and spurns</div>
<div class="i1">Its proud oppressors; frantic with delight,</div>
<div class="i1">My fancy riots in successive scenes</div>
<a name="Page_225" id="Page_225"></a><span class="pageno">225</span>
<div class="i1">Of bliss and pleasures: plans and schemes are laid</div>
<div class="i1">How best the fleeting moments to improve,</div>
<div class="i1">Nor lose one portion of so rare a boon.</div>
<div class="i1">But soon, too soon, the glorious scenes are fled,</div>
<div class="i1">Scarce one short moon enjoy’d; (oh! transient state</div>
<div class="i1">Of sublunary bliss!) by bitter change,</div>
<div class="i1">And other scenes succeeded, what fierce pangs</div>
<div class="i1">Then rack my soul! what ceaseless floods of grief</div>
<div class="i1">Rush down my cheeks, while strong convulsive throbs</div>
<div class="i1">Heave all my frame, and choak the power of speech!</div>
<div class="i1">Forlorn I sigh, nor heed the gentle voice</div>
<div class="i1">Of friend or stranger, who, with soothing words</div>
<div class="i1">And slender gift, would fain beguile my woes:</div>
<div class="i1">In vain; for what can aught avail to sooth</div>
<div class="i1">Such raging anguish? Oft with sudden glance</div>
<div class="i1">Before my eyes in all its horror glares</div>
<div class="i1">That well-known form, and oft I seem to hear</div>
<div class="i1">The thundering scourge&mdash;ah me! e’en now I feel</div>
<div class="i1">Its deadly venom, raging as the pangs</div>
<div class="i1">That tore Alcides, when the burning vest</div>
<div class="i1">Prey’d on his wasted sides,&mdash;At length return’d</div>
<div class="i1">Within these hated walls, again I mourn</div>
<div class="i1">A sullen prisoner, till the wish’d approach</div>
<div class="i1">Of joyous holiday or festive play</div>
<div class="i1">Releases me: ah! freedom that must end</div>
<div class="i1">With thee, declining Sol! All hail, ye sires</div>
<div class="i1">For sanctity renown’d, whose glorious names,</div>
<div class="i1">In large conspicuous characters pourtray’d,</div>
<div class="i1">Adorn the annual chronologic page</div>
<div class="i1">Of Wing or Partridge; oft, when sore opprest</div>
<div class="i1">With dire calamities, the glad return</div>
<div class="i1">Of your triumphant festivals hath cheer’d</div>
<div class="i1">My drooping soul. Nor be thy name forgot,</div>
<div class="i1">Illustrious George: for much to thee I owe</div>
<div class="i1">Of heart-felt rapture, as with loyal zeal</div>
<div class="i1">Glowing, I pile the crackling bonfire high,</div>
<div class="i1">Or hurl the mounting rocket through the air,</div>
<div class="i1">Or fiery whizzing serpent; thus thy name</div>
<div class="i1">Shall still be honour’d, as through future years</div>
<div class="i1">The circling Seasons roll their festive round.</div>
<div class="i1">Sometimes, by dire compulsive hunger press’d,</div>
<div class="i1">I spring the neighbouring fence, and scale the trunk</div>
<div class="i1">Of apple-tree; or wide, o’er flowery lawns,</div>
<div class="i1">By hedge or thicket, bend my hasty steps,</div>
<div class="i1">Intent, with secret ambush, to surprise,</div>
<div class="i1">The straw-built nest, and unsuspecting brood</div>
<div class="i1">Of thrush or bull-finch; oft with watchful ken</div>
<div class="i1">Eyeing the backward lawns, lest hostile glance</div>
<div class="i1">Observe my footsteps, while each rustling leaf,</div>
<div class="i1">Stirr’d by the gentle gale, alarms my fears:</div>
<div class="i1">Then, parched beneath the burning heats of noon,</div>
<div class="i1">I plunge into the limpid stream, that laves</div>
<div class="i1">The silent vale; or, on its grassy banks,</div>
<div class="i1">Beneath some oak’s majestic shade recline,</div>
<div class="i1">Envying the vagrant fishes, as they pass,</div>
<div class="i1">Their boon of freedom; till the distant sound</div>
<div class="i1">Of tolling curfew warns me to depart.</div>
<div class="i1">Thus under tyrant-pow’r I groan, oppress’d</div>
<div class="i1">With worse than slavery; yet my free-born soul</div>
<div class="i1">Her native warmth forgets not, nor will brook</div>
<div class="i1">Menace, or taunt, from proud insulting peer;</div>
<div class="i1">But summons to the field the doughty foe</div>
<div class="i1">In single combat, ’midst th’ impartial throng,</div>
<div class="i1">There to decide our fate: oft too, inflam’d</div>
<div class="i1">With mutual rage, two rival armies meet</div>
<div class="i1">Of youthful warriors; kindling at the sight,</div>
<div class="i1">My soul is filled with vast heroic thoughts,</div>
<div class="i1">Trusting, in martial glory, to surpass</div>
<div class="i1">Roman or Grecian chief; instant, with shouts,</div>
<div class="i1">The mingling squadrons join the horrid fray;</div>
<div class="i1">No need of cannon, or the murderous steel,</div>
<div class="i1">Wide wasting nature: rage our arms supplies.</div>
<div class="i1">Fragments of rock are hurl’d, and showers of stones</div>
<div class="i1">Obscure the day; nor less the brawny arm,</div>
<div class="i1">Or knotted club, avail; high in the midst</div>
<div class="i1">Are seen the mighty chiefs, through hosts of foes</div>
<div class="i1">Mowing their way; and now, with tenfold rage</div>
<div class="i1">The combat burns, full many a sanguine stream</div>
<div class="i1">Distains the field, and many a veteran brave</div>
<div class="i1">Lies prostrate; loud triumphant shouts ascend</div>
<div class="i1">By turns from either host; each claims the palm</div>
<div class="i1">Of glorious conquest; nor till night’s dun shades</div>
<div class="i1">Involve the sky, the doubtful conflict ends.</div>
<div class="i1">Thus, when rebellion shook the thrones of heaven,</div>
<div class="i1">And all th’ eternal powers in battle met,</div>
<div class="i1">High o’er the rest, with vast gigantic strides,</div>
<div class="i1">The god-like leaders, on th’ embattled plain,</div>
<div class="i1">Came towering, breathing forth revenge and fate:</div>
<div class="i1">Nor less terrific joined the inferior hosts</div>
<div class="i1">Of angel-warriors, when encountering hills</div>
<div class="i1">Tore the rent concave&mdash;flashing with the blaze</div>
<div class="i1">Of fiery arms, and lightnings, not of Jove;</div>
<div class="i1">All heaven resounded, and the astonish’d deep</div>
<div class="i1">Of chaos bellow’d with the monstrous roar.</div>

<div class="poemtitle"><span class="sc">First Prize</span>.</div>
<div class="i1">Thus pondering how they best might frame reply,</div>
<div class="i1">Unto their Sovereign’s speech, mute and perplexed</div>
<div class="i1">Sat all the Peers, awaiting who appeared</div>
<div class="i1">To second, or oppose, or undertake</div>
<div class="i1">The perilous attempt, till Onslow, raised</div>
<div class="i1">Alike by merit and the Premier’s choice</div>
<div class="i1">To that bad eminence, in glib-set speech</div>
<div class="i1">Began: “Since silent all, great powers, ye wait</div>
<div class="i1">Counsel and guidance, I myself have framed</div>
<div class="i1">A loyal Address of dutiful assent,</div>
<div class="i1">Declaring confidence in this our State</div>
<div class="i1">And those whose prudence guides it,&mdash;fit reply!”</div>
<div class="i1">He spoke, and from the other side uprose</div>
<div class="i1">Granville, in act most graceful and humane</div>
<div class="i1">Of all who fell from office, breathing forth</div>
<div class="i1">Hatred implacable, and straight denounced</div>
<div class="i1">Revenge, and dissolution dangerous</div>
<div class="i1">To less than Peers. Louder applause was heard</div>
<div class="i1">As Granville ended, and his sentence pleased,</div>
<div class="i1">Counselling revolt, which, when the Premier saw,</div>
<div class="i1">Lord Beaconsfield, than whom of all the powers,</div>
<div class="i1">Save the Lord Chancellor, none higher sat,</div>
<div class="i1">With grave aspect he rose. High on his front</div>
<div class="i1">The curl of Vivian clung, though thinned with years,</div>
<div class="i1">Majestic still in ruin; and with knee</div>
<div class="i1">Somewhat advanced, as if perchance to show</div>
<div class="i1">Its mystic circlet, thus imperious spoke:</div>
<div class="i1">“Peers of the Empire, still ye look to me,</div>
<div class="i1">Your chief, for still to me the popular vote</div>
<div class="i1">Inclines, here to continue, and build up here</div>
<div class="i1">A growing Empire, so with Freedom joined;</div>
<div class="i1">Receive my words, nor heed inferior tongues,</div>
<div class="i1">False to their Sovereign and to our State,</div>
<div class="i1">Counselling ignoble ease and peaceful sloth,</div>
<div class="i1">Not peace. Well have ye judged of old, and still</div>
<a name="Page_226" id="Page_226"></a><span class="pageno">226</span>
<div class="i1">Ye shall judge well, discerning to avoid,</div>
<div class="i1">By me advised, shameful dismemberment</div>
<div class="i1">Of this great realm.” He ceased, and straight the powers</div>
<div class="i1">Their session ended, voted the Address,</div>
<div class="i1">Momentous issue of prolonged debate.</div>

<p>“<span class="sc">Prae Existence</span>, a Poem in imitation of
Milton.” London: Printed for John Clark, at the
Bible and Crown in the Old Change, near St.
Paul’s, 1714. This work was published anonymously,
but it had a long Publisher’s Preface,
signed J.B., under which initials it may be traced
in the catalogue of the British Museum Library

(Press Mark 11,631, b.b.b. 39). The Preface
states that the structure of the Poem is founded on
the opinion “<cite>That all human souls had an existence
antecedent to the Mosaic Creation</cite>,” and is intended
as an account of the events that occurred in the
interval between the battle of <em>Michael</em> and <em>Lucifer</em>,
and the creation of the World.</p>

Lucifer’s discomfiture:<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

his poem with the Archangels sounding a retreat

the Poem is not of a very light or cheerful description.

<div class="i2">Off, blubbering Melancholy!</div>
<div class="i1">Of the blue devils and book-learning born,</div>

<div class="i1">Amongst black-gowns, square caps, and books unjolly,</div>
<div class="i1">Hunt out some college cell,</div>

<div class="i1">By gentles called Festivity,</div>

<div class="i1">Hip! here, jade, and bring with thee</div>
<div class="i1">Jokes and sniggering jollity,</div>
<div class="i1">Christmas gambols, waggish tricks,</div>
<div class="i1">Winks, wry faces, licks and kicks,</div>
<div class="i1">Such as fall from Moggy’s, knuckles,</div>
<div class="i1">And love to live about her buckles;</div>
<div class="i1">Game, that hobbling watchmen boxes,</div>
<div class="i1">And Horse-laugh hugging both his doxies;</div>
<div class="i1">Come, and kick it as you go,</div>
<div class="i1">On the stumping hornpipe-toe:</div>

<div class="i1">From his watch-box in the alley</div>
<div class="i1">Till the watch at six doth sally;</div>
<div class="i1">Then to go, in spite of sleep,</div>
<div class="i1">And at the window cry, “Sweep! sweep!”</div>
<div class="i1">Through the street-door, or the area,</div>
<div class="i1">Or, in the country, through the dairy;</div>
<div class="i1">While the dustman, with his din,</div>
<div class="i1">Bawls and rings to be let in,</div>
<div class="i1">And at the fore, or the back-door,</div>
<div class="i1">Slowly plods his jades before.</div>
<div class="i1">Oft hearing the sow-gelder’s horn</div>
<div class="i1">Harshly rouse the snoring morn,</div>
<div class="i1">From the side of a large square,</div>
<div class="i1">Through the long street grunting far.</div>
<div class="i1">Sometimes walking I’ll be seen</div>
<div class="i1">By Tower-hill, or Moorfields green,</div>
<div class="i1">Right against Old Bedlam-gate,</div>
<div class="i1">Where the mock king begins his state,</div>
<div class="i1">Crown’d with straw, and rob’d with rags,</div>
<div class="i1">Cover’d o’er with jags and tags,</div>
<div class="i1">While the keeper near at hand</div>
<div class="i1">Bullies those who leave their stand;</div>
<div class="i1">And milk-maid’s screams go through your ears,</div>
<div class="i1">And grinders sharpen rusty sheers,</div>
<div class="i1">And every crier squalls his cry</div>
<div class="i1">Under each window he goes by.</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i2">Straight mine eye hath caught new gambols,</div>
<div class="i1">While round and round this town it rambles;</div>
<div class="i1">Sloppy streets and foggy day,</div>
<div class="i1">Where the blundering folks do stray!</div>
<div class="i1">Pavements, on whose slippery flags</div>
<div class="i1">Swearing coach-men drive their nags;</div>
<div class="i1">Barbers jostled ’gainst your side,</div>
<div class="i1">Narrow streets, and gutters wide.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i2">Grub-street garrets now it sees,</div>
<div class="i1">To the muse open and the breeze,</div>
<div class="i1">Where perhaps some scribbler hungers,</div>
<div class="i1">The hack of neighbouring newsmongers,</div>
<div class="i1">Hard by, a tinker’s furnace smokes,</div>
<div class="i1">From betwixt two pastry-cooks,</div>
<div class="i1">Where dingy Dick and Peggy, met,</div>
<div class="i1">Are at their scurvy dinner set,</div>
<div class="i1">Of cow-heel, and such cellar messes,</div>
<div class="i1">Which the splay-foot Rachael dresses;</div>
<div class="i1">And then in haste the shop she leaves,</div>
<div class="i1">And with the boy the bellows heaves;</div>
<div class="i1">Or if ’tis late, and shop is shut,</div>
<div class="i1">Scrubs at the pump her face from smut,</div>
<div class="i1">Sometimes, all for sights agog,</div>
<div class="i1">To t’other end of the town I jog.</div>
<div class="i1">When St. James’s bells ring round,</div>
<div class="i1">And the royal fiddles sound,</div>
<div class="i1">And young and old dance down the tune,</div>
<div class="i1">In honour of the forth of June;</div>
<div class="i1">Till candles fail and eyes are sore,</div>
<div class="i1">Then home we hie to talk it o’er,</div>
<div class="i1">With stories told of many a treat,</div>
<div class="i1">How Lady Swab the sweetmeats eat;</div>
<div class="i1">She was pinch’d and something worse,</div>
<div class="i1">And she was fobb’d and lost her purse,</div>
<div class="i1">Tell how the drudging Weltjee sweat,</div>
<div class="i1">To bake his custards duly set,</div>
<div class="i1">When in one night, ere clock went seven,</div>
<div class="i1">His ’prentice-lad had robb’d the oven</div>
<div class="i1">Of more than twenty hands had put in;</div>
<div class="i1">Then lies him down, a little glutton,</div>
<div class="i1">Stretch’d lumbering ’fore the fire, they tell ye,</div>
<div class="i1">And bakes the custards in his belly;</div>
<div class="i1">Then crop-sick down the stairs he flings</div>
<div class="i1">Before his master’s bell yet rings,</div>
<div class="i1">Thus done the tales, to bed they creep</div>
<div class="i1">By hoofs and wheels soon lull’d to sleep.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i2">But the city takes me then,</div>
<div class="i1">And the <em>hums</em> of busy men,</div>
<div class="i1">Where throngs of train-band captains bold</div>
<div class="i1">In time of peace fierce meetings hold,</div>
<div class="i1">With stores of stock-jobbers, whose lies</div>
<div class="i1">Work change of stocks and bankruptcies;</div>
<div class="i1">Where bulls and bears alike contend</div>
<div class="i1">To get the cash they dare not spend.</div>
<div class="i1">Then let aldermen appear,</div>
<div class="i1">In scarlet robes, with chandelier,</div>
<div class="i1">And city feasts and gluttony,</div>
<div class="i1">With balls upon the lord mayor’s day;</div>
<div class="i1">Sights that young ’prentices remember,</div>
<div class="i1">Sleeping or waking, all November.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i2">Then to the play-houses anon,</div>
<div class="i1">If Quick or Bannister be one;</div>
<div class="i1">Or drollest Parsons, child of Drury,</div>
<div class="i1">Bawls out his damns with comic fury,</div>
<div class="i1">And ever, against hum-drum cares,</div>
<div class="i1">Sing me some of Dibdin’s airs,</div>
<div class="i1">Married to his own queer wit,</div>
<div class="i1">Such as my shaking sides may split,</div>
<div class="i1">In notes, with many a jolly bout,</div>
<div class="i1">Near Beaufort Buildings oft roar’d out,</div>
<div class="i1">With Wagging curls and smirk so cunning,</div>
<div class="i1">His rig on many a booby running,</div>
<div class="i1">Exposing all the ways and phizzes</div>
<div class="i1">Of “wags, and oddities and quizzes,”</div>
<div class="i1">That Shuter’s self might heave his head</div>
<div class="i1">From drunken snoozes, on a bed</div>
<div class="i1">Of pot-house benches sprawl’d, and hear</div>
<div class="i1">Such laughing songs as won the ear</div>
<div class="i1">Of all the town, his slip to cover,</div>
<div class="i1">Whene’er he met ’em half-seas over.</div>

<div class="i1">Thy heels well arm’d with rowels long,</div>
<div class="i1">The cap close fitted to thy head,</div>
<div class="i1">The blue plush coat, the waistcoat red;</div>
<div class="i1">Thy person trim, succinct, and light</div>
<div class="i1">Breechee’d high in buckskin tight;</div>
<div class="i1">Mounted on a courser fleet,</div>
<div class="i1">With ardent eyes and pawing feet;</div>
<div class="i1">Hence, with thy tall tail-curling hound,</div>
<div class="i1">Of tongue so shrill and ears so round.</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i2">No more I listen to the noise</div>
<div class="i1">Of “wind him, rogues,” and “to him boys,”</div>

<div class="i1">And “gone away,” and “there they go;”</div>

<div class="i1">Sober, steadfast, and demure,</div>
<div class="i1">Clad in a coat of clumsy size,</div>
<div class="i1">Of double drab or knotted frieze,</div>
<div class="i1">O’er which is drawn the warm surtout</div>
<div class="i1">With flourish’d girdle bound about;</div>
<div class="i1">Thy vacant forehead broad and fat,</div>
<div class="i1">Shadow’d beneath the round-cropp’d hat.</div>

<div class="i1">Whom in a solitary vale</div>

<div class="i1">Come, but keep your wonted state</div>
<div class="i1">On a horse of sluggish gait;</div>
<div class="i1">Your looks commencing with the ground,</div>
<div class="i1">Where the close-crouching hare is found;</div>
<div class="i1">And as across the lands you creep,</div>
<div class="i1">Forget yourself and fall asleep</div>
<div class="i1">Till the dull steed shall break your nap,</div>
<div class="i1">Stumbling through the accustom’d gap.</div>
<div class="i1">And first the waddling beagle bring,</div>
<div class="i1">That looks as just escaped the string,</div>
<div class="i1">With sneaking tail and heavy head,</div>
<div class="i1">Such as by neighbour Dash are bred;</div>
<div class="i1">And join sharp Cold with Ache severe,</div>
<div class="i1">And Patience, that can bear to hear</div>
<div class="i1">The pack with melancholy tone</div>
<div class="i1">Around the scented hillock moan,</div>

<div class="i1">While such mean merriment invites,</div>
<div class="i1">Doing thy sadly-pleasing rites.</div>
<div class="i1">Oft, on a plat of rising ground,</div>
<div class="i1">I see the fat pack puzzling round,</div>
<div class="i1">Where the game went long before,</div>
<div class="i1">Sounding sad with sullen roar;</div>
<div class="i1">With slow-paced heed, and tedious cunning,</div>
<div class="i1">Through all her artful mazes running,</div>
<div class="i1">Untwisting every knotty wile</div>
<div class="i1">Both of the double and the foil;</div>
<div class="i1">In notes with many a winding bout</div>
<div class="i1">Of drowsy murmurings long-drawn out,</div>
<div class="i1">Bewailing their dull master’s folly,</div>
<div class="i1">Most pitiful, most melancholy,</div>
<div class="i1">But chiefly let the Southern’s tongue</div>
<div class="i1">Drag its deep dismal tone along,</div>
<div class="i1">In bellowings loud, and utterance hoarse,</div>
<div class="i1">Such as its mournful way may force</div>
<div class="i1">Through all my hearing’s cavities,</div>
<div class="i1">And bring the tears into my eyes.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i2">But let my due sight never fail,</div>
<div class="i1">Where beaten paths divide the vale,</div>
<div class="i1">With anxious skill and cunning care,</div>
<div class="i1">To prick the footsteps of the hare,</div>
<div class="i1">While I cheer the beagle’s toil,</div>
<div class="i1">With “hoo the way,” and “hark the foil!”</div>
<div class="i1">And when at last old age and gout</div>
<div class="i1">Prevent my longer going out,</div>
<div class="i1">O may I from my easy chair</div>
<div class="i1">The wonders of my youth declare,</div>
<div class="i1">Extol at large myself and steed,</div>
<div class="i1">And talk of hounds of my old breed,</div>
<div class="i1">Till I become through neighbouring shires</div>
<div class="i1">The oracle of country squires.</div>
<div class="i1">These pleasures, Hare Hunting, impart,</div>
<div class="i1">And I am thine with all my heart.</div>

by Routledge, Warnes and Routledge, London, in
1859. This little volume contains parodies of
Father Prout; Thomas Campbell; Longfellow;
Hood; Tennyson; Barry Cornwall; Macaulay;
Pope, and Thackeray. It is now known that it
was written by Samuel Lover, the novelist, it will,

<div class="i1">Now here, now there, and everywhere,</div>
<div class="i1">Now sailing on with lofty bound,</div>
<div class="i1">Now creeping slowly o’er the ground.</div>
<div class="i1">The players now, an eager crew,</div>
<div class="i1">The well encasèd ball pursue,</div>

<div class="i2">A seething, surging, kicking mass.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And now, while still they push and shout,</div>
<div class="i1">The well-kicked ball creeps slowly out.</div>
<div class="i1">A nimble-footed youth espies</div>
<div class="i1">And after it like lightning flies,</div>
<div class="i1">And, ere his foes see through the trick,</div>
<div class="i1">Essays a deftly-aimèd kick.</div>
<div class="i1">“Home,” cries the keeper of the goal,</div>
<div class="i1">Too late from scrummage rush the shoal,</div>
<div class="i2">The ball skims o’er the opposing hosts,</div>
<div class="i2">And gently drops between the posts.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Now change they sides, and soon again</div>
<div class="i1">The ball is speeding o’er the plain,</div>
<div class="i1">While after it each eager wight</div>
<div class="i1">Scampers in transports of delight.</div>
<div class="i1">Until at length he respite seeks,</div>
<div class="i1">With wearied limbs but rosy cheeks.</div>
<div class="i1">His mud-bespattered garments shows</div>
<div class="i1">How oft on Earth he’s laid him low;</div>

<div class="i1">He feels the hot blood through him course,</div>
<div class="i2">And knows that in his much-loved game,</div>
<div class="i2">He’s found both pleasure, health, and fame.</div>

<p>In 1879 the Editor of <cite>The World</cite> commenced a
series of Prize Parody Competitions, the sixth of

Matthew Arnold’s Sonnet on George Cruikshank’s
picture, “The Bottle.”</p>

 <p>The first and second prizes were awarded to
<span class="sc">V.A.C.A.</span> and <span class="sc">Fess-Gules</span>, and two other parodies
were also printed.</p>

 <p>Matthew Arnold’s original sonnet is here given,

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Tracy Turnerelli’s Golden Wreath.</span></p>

<p>On <a href="#Page_188">page 188</a>, <cite>Parodies</cite>, a history was given of
the wreath which was offered to Lord Beaconsfield
by Mr. Tracy Turnerelli, and some parodies of
<a name="edit237" id="edit237"></a>Shakespeare, and of Ben Jonson, descriptive of the
circumstances which induced Lord Beaconsfield to
refuse the offer.</p>

<p>The Editor of <cite>The World</cite> selected the topic for
a parody competition, entitled “Mr. Tracy Turnerelli
in the Provinces,” the model proposed for
imitation being Mr. Matthew Arnold’s beautiful
poem, “The Forsaken Merman,” and the compositions
were limited to forty lines.</p>

<p>The agitation to which this Parody calls attention may
have been initiated with all sincerity and purity of motives,
but it has directly encouraged the hawking about of some of
the most abominable publications which have ever yet been
publicly exposed for sale.</p>

<p>To protect “fallen” women is, no doubt, a most laudable
and philanthropic object, but it should be possible to do
this without either annoying other members of the community,
or outraging public decency. Some of the best
streets of London were recently rendered impassable to
modest women by the foul-mouthed ruffians who exposed these
filthy publications for sale, and touted their wares in language
more vile and repulsive than even the publications they
disposed of dared to venture on.</p>

<div class="i1">With sherry on this side, and port on that;</div>

<div class="i1">And then the princely turbot, with the lemon</div>
<div class="i1">And shrimp or oyster sauce, making it glide</div>
<div class="i1">Most palatably down; and then the entrées,</div>
<div class="i1">Smelling divinely in their shallow basins</div>

<div class="i1">With eyes intent we watch each slice that’s cut,</div>
<div class="i1">Full of good things and spicy substances;</div>
<div class="i1">And so we take a part. The sixth course drifts</div>
<div class="i1">Into the plain and usual dessert,</div>
<div class="i1">With walnuts ’neath one’s nose, and port each side;</div>
<div class="i1">Our evening clothes were made on purpose wide</div>
<div class="i1">To hold such stuff. And now some manly voice,</div>
<div class="i1">Turning towards politics and meerschaum-pipes,</div>
<div class="i1">Makes ladies leave the room. Last course of all</div>

<p>This old fashioned comic song, written by F. C.
Burnand, was sung in the Burlo-Drama of <cite>Julius
Cnaeser</cite> at the Royalty Theatre. The chorus has
here been somewhat abbreviated, as its wit was not
in proportion to its length. A parody, having a
similar refrain, appeared in Volume 1, <cite>Parodies</cite>,

<p>Another amusing Parody of <cite>Hiawatha</cite> was published
in <cite>The Bill of the Play</cite> for July 11, 1870.
It was entitled “La Belle Sauvage” and gave a
summary of the burlesque history of the Princess
Pocahontas then being performed at the St. James’s
Theatre. It is, unfortunately, out of date now,
and much too long to be given here.</p>

<p>A few other parodies of Hood’s Poems may be
enumerated, which are not of sufficient interest to
be reprinted. “The Age” for June 6, 1885, contained
a poem, called, “The Song of the Streets,”
deploring the noises of London. In the Manchester
“Free Lance” there was a parody (of
purely local interest) of “<cite>I remember, I remember</cite>,”
entitled “Manchester Musings;” and a Manchester
clothier, named Whitham, advertises his goods in
a handbill containing a very fair parody of “The
Bridge of Sighs.” In <cite>The Saturday Review</cite> of
August 29, 1885, there was a political poem, “A
Case of Conscience,” modelled upon “The Dream
of Eugene Aram.”</p>

<p>In 1848 a small volume was published by T. C.
Newby, of Mortimer Street, London, entitled “A

Vision of Great Men, with other Poems,” by
Caroline de Crespigny.</p>

<p>“A Vision of Great Men” was addressed to the
author of “A Dream of Fair Women,” and was
written in imitation, but not as a parody, of that
poem; of the “Great Men” alluded to, the
principal were Columbus, and Napoleon the first.
The poem consisted of seventy-four verses.</p>

<div class="i1">Comrades, leave me here a little, I have thoughts you cannot know;</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">’Tis the place, and all around it, as of old, the brawlers brawl,</div>
<div class="i1">Dreary bores about St. Stephen’s vying for the Speaker’s call.</div>

<div class="i1">Many a night from yonder benches, when I longed to be in bed,</div>
<div class="i1">Saw I not the great Orion, but the Grand Old Man instead.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Saw I not the starry Pleiads, but the meteor stars that fade,</div>

<div class="i1">Here about the floor I waited, when I knew my youth sublime,</div>

<div class="i1">Then I dipped into the future, far as one keen eye could see,</div>

<div class="i1">Saying from a height prophetic, “You shall hear me by and by,”</div>

<div class="i1">I waited for the boat at Hungerford;</div>
<div class="i1">I hung with snobs and swells upon the bridge,</div>
<div class="i1">To watch the muddy water; there I shaped</div>
<div class="i1">The City’s ancient legend into this:&mdash;</div>
<div class="tb">*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*</div>
<div class="i1">Not only we of Eighteen Fifty-seven,</div>
<div class="i1">Smart men that, swift as streak of lightning greased,</div>
<div class="i1">Make and spend “tin”&mdash;not only we that prate</div>
<div class="i1">Of progress, learning, and “Excelsior,”</div>
<div class="i1">Have loved ourselves full well and turned up trumps</div>
<div class="i1">At life’s great game of whist&mdash;but surely he</div>
<div class="i1">“Did more, and underwent, and overcame,”&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">The wight of some few hundred summers back,</div>
<div class="i1">Whittington, ’prentice erst to some dull cit,</div>
<div class="i1">Some wheezy councilman&mdash;who worked him hard,</div>
<div class="i1">And gave him the allowance monkeys have,</div>
<div class="i1">More kicks than half-pence&mdash;and, when asked for more,</div>
<div class="i1">Showed him the street, and kicked him into it</div>
<div class="i1">With turned-up toe, saying “Begone and starve!”</div>
<div class="i1">He sought relief in vain, for in those days</div>
<div class="i1">Were no “relieving officers”&mdash;his thoughts</div>
<div class="i1">Turned to his childhood’s home, far, far away,</div>
<div class="i1">Embowered in tufted trees where cooed the dove,</div>
<div class="i1">Where sang a chorus sweet of jenny-wrens,</div>
<div class="i1">Tom-tits, and gay cock-sparrows&mdash;and he said,</div>
<div class="i1">“It must be so&mdash;farewel, ambitious dreams,”</div>
<div class="i1">(“Farewel,” he would have said, “to all my greatness,”</div>
<div class="i1">But he had never gentle Shakespeare read,</div>
<div class="i1">Nor seen the play of England’s bluff King Hal</div>
<div class="i1">Performed at the Princess’s). “So, farewell&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Clown was I born, and to clod-hopping life</div>
<div class="i1">I must return”&mdash;and then he ’gan to snivel,</div>
<div class="i1">And wipe his nose upon his jerkin’s cuff;</div>
<div class="i1">(For his were days when Manchester was not,</div>
<div class="i1">And dear were pocket handkerchiefs).</div>
<div class="i1">Then this poor boy wound slow his mournful way</div>
<div class="i1">Towards Highgate’s hill&mdash;and up the steep ascent</div>
<div class="i1">Toiled wearily&mdash;yet deem not him alone,</div>
<div class="i1">For at his heels there walked a faithful friend,</div>
<div class="i1">A gentle quadruped&mdash;a fond Grimalkin</div>
<div class="i1">Who purred between her master’s weary legs,</div>
<div class="i1">Till he looked down and saw her at his feet,</div>
<div class="i1">And wept at such four-footed sympathy.</div>
<div class="i1">So with their honest backs to London town</div>
<div class="i1">These twain toiled valiantly up Highgate hill.</div>
<div class="i1">They sat them down at last&mdash;for Whittington</div>
<div class="i1">Was very hungry&mdash;and on bread and cheese</div>
<div class="i1">In equitable portions dined they then.</div>
<div class="i1">But up he starts&mdash;and lo! what is’t he hears</div>
<div class="i1">Clanged with great shock of sound from distant bells</div>
<div class="i1">Of Bow in Cheapside? Say they rightly thus?</div>
<div class="i1">“Return! return! great Whittington return!</div>
<div class="i1">Thou shalt of London’s City be Lord Mayor!”</div>
<div class="i1">Such were the words&mdash;or hope was much mistaken&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Such were the words. Backward again they hied,</div>
<div class="i1">He, and his cat, the solace of his sorrows,</div>
<div class="i1">As partner of his joys&mdash;but, if she thought</div>
<div class="i1">That such a Co. could long exist, methinks</div>
<div class="i1">The poor Grimalkin then was slightly “sold.”</div>
<div class="i1">But I am speaking rather in the tense</div>
<div class="i1">Hight <i>Paulo post-futurum</i>. To my theme:</div>
<div class="i1">Backward he hied&mdash;re-entered London town,</div>
<div class="i1">Obtained employment as a quill-driver,</div>
<div class="i1">A very drudge for three long bitter years;</div>
<div class="i1">But still the cat sat ’neath his stool by day</div>
<div class="i1">And slept upon his truckle-bed at night.</div>
<div class="i1">Now Whittington’s employer was a merchant,</div>
<div class="i1">Who sent forth ships to trade beyond the seas</div>
<div class="i1">One of his captains saw&mdash;admired the cat,</div>
<div class="i1">And with her sailed to China, land of dirt,</div>
<div class="i1">Rice, lorchas, pigtails, ivory deftly carved,</div>
<div class="i1">And ladies with short toes bent backward. Soon</div>
<div class="i1">Made he acquaintance with the Emperor,</div>
<div class="i1">The brother of the Sun and Moon, celestial “swell,</div>
<div class="i1">First cousin to the Stars; for in those days</div>
<div class="i1">Men craved not introduction&mdash;Bowring then</div>
<div class="i1">Had not been sent out as Ambassador,</div>
<div class="i1">Nor Seymour to bombard their tin-pot towns.</div>
<div class="i1">Now it so happened that this Emperor’s</div>
<div class="i1">Imperial snuggery was overrun</div>
<div class="i1">With mice who stole the delicate tit-bits</div>
<div class="i1">From off the table of the Stars’ first cousin,</div>
<div class="i1">And cats till then in China were unknown,</div>
<div class="i1">And Whittington’s Grimalkin had three kittens,</div>
<div class="i1">And so the Brother of the Sun and Moon</div>
<div class="i1">Purchased the cat of Whittington for a sum</div>
<div class="i1">Which would content <em>me</em> for <em>my</em> lease of life,</div>
<div class="i1">Invested snugly in the Three-per-Cents.</div>
<div class="i1">The Captain homeward sailed to England’s shore,</div>
<div class="i1">And paid his sum to Whittington&mdash;so he</div>
<div class="i1">Became a sucking Crœsus&mdash;bought and sold,</div>
<div class="i1">And “rigged the market” like our “bulls” and “bears,”</div>
<div class="i1">Became a man whose name across a bill</div>
<div class="i1">Drew ready cash&mdash;then Sheriff&mdash;then Lord Mayor,</div>
<div class="i1">And built himself an everlasting name:</div>
<div class="i1">And of his acts if more ye wish to learn,</div>
<div class="i1">Are they not written in the picture books</div>
<div class="i1">Of Messrs. Darton upon Holborn hill!</div>
<div class="i1">As for his cat&mdash;I’ve little more to tell.</div>
<div class="i1">Save that she lived and multiplied her species</div>
<div class="i1">For the great Brother of the Son and Moon;</div>
<div class="i1">And her descendants, worthy of their dam,</div>
<div class="i1">E’en now are mewing loud in great Canton,</div>
<div class="i1">Unless that stout Drawcansir, Chinese Yeh,</div>
<div class="i1">Hath poisoned the poor innocents because</div>
<div class="i1">Their ancestress was British!</div>

<p>“The sonnet written by Mr. Tennyson as an introduction to
the <cite>Nineteenth Century</cite> has excited universal attention and
admiration. Some people, however, are understood to have
complained that they cannot exactly penetrate the meaning
which the poet wishes to convey. But this is entirely their
own fault, as, if they had studied the whole history of the
secession from the <cite>Contemporary</cite>, they would fully appreciate
the charm, and the appropriateness of the Laureates’ verses.”</p>

<div class="i1">You’re the sort of fellow that likes to drown with his toe on the ground.</div>
<div class="i1">However, you turn upon me and my creed with all sorts of abuse;</div>
<div class="i1">As if any preaching of mine could possibly be of use</div>
<div class="i1">To a man who refused to see what sort of a world he had got</div>
<div class="i1">To live in and make the best of, whether he liked it or not.</div>
<div class="i1">I am not sure what you mean: you seem to mean to say</div>
<div class="i1">That believing in hell you were happy; but that one unfortunate day</div>
<div class="i1">You found out you knew nothing about it, whereby the troubles of life</div>
<div class="i1">Became at once too heavy to bear for yourself and your wife.</div>
<div class="i1">That sounds silly; so perhaps you may mean that all is wrong all round&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">My creed and the know-nothing books&mdash;and that truth is not to be found,</div>
<div class="i1">That’s sillier still; for if so the know-nothing books are right,</div>
<div class="i1">And you’re a mere spiritless cur, who can neither run nor fight&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Too great a coward to live, and too great a coward to die,</div>
<div class="i1">Fit for nothing at all but just to sit down and cry.</div>
<div class="i1">Not that you’re really unhappy. I don’t think you ever were.</div>
<div class="i1">Give you a poet’s corner, and a pipe and an easy chair,</div>
<div class="i1">And a woman or two to pet you, and you never gave way to despair,</div>
<div class="i1">You might sell it at so much a line&mdash;but that’s quite another affair.</div>
<div class="i1">Why in the midst of your whines it’s impossible not to see</div>
<div class="i1">How anxious you are to show that you’re only attacking me,</div>
<div class="i1">And that you’ve not a word to say against respectable people</div>
<div class="i1">Who own no connection between my chapel and their church-steeple.</div>
<div class="i1">You always contrive to hint, and almost seem to feel</div>
<div class="i1">That your creed would have been much better if your Church had been more genteel.</div>
<div class="i1">Why, man, we’re all in one boat, as every one can see,</div>
<div class="i1">Bishops and priests and deacons, and poor little ranters like me.</div>
<div class="i1">There’s hell in the Church of England, and hell in the Church of Rome:</div>
<div class="i1">And in all other Christian Churches, abroad as well as at home.</div>
<div class="i1">The part of my creed you dislike may be too stern for you.</div>
<div class="i1">Many brave men believe it&mdash;aye, and enjoy life too.</div>
<div class="i1">The know-nothing books may alarm you; but many a better man</div>
<div class="i1">Knows he knows nothing, and says so, and lives the best life he can.</div>
<div class="i1">If there is a future state, face its hopes and terrors gravely;</div>
<div class="i1">The best path to it must be to bear life’s burdens bravely.</div>
<div class="i1">And even if there is none, why should not you live like a man,</div>
<div class="i1">Enjoying whatever you have as much and as long as you can.</div>
<div class="i1">In the world in which we are living there’s plenty to do and to know,</div>
<div class="i1">And there’s always something to hope for, till its time for us to go.</div>
<div class="i1">Despair is the vilest of words, unfit to be said or thought,</div>
<div class="i1">Whether there is a God and a future state or not.</div>
<div class="i1">If you really are such a wretch that you’re quite unfit to live,</div>
<div class="i1">And ask my advice I’ll give you the best that I have to give.</div>
<div class="i1">Drown yourself by all means; I was wrong and you were right;</div>
<div class="i1">I’ll not pull you out any more; but be sure you drown yourself quite.</div>

<p>This book was written in a period when many words had not become
standardized in their spelling. Words may have multiple spelling
variations or inconsistent hyphenation in the text. These have been
left unchanged unless indicated below. Dialect was not changed. “The
Splendid Shilling” is presented as an exact reprint; the long s (ſ)
was retained in this poem.</p>

<p>Footnotes were renumbered sequentially and were moved to the
end of the book. Two footnotes were not printed, page 229. All three anchors resolve to <a href="#footnote_51">[51]</a>.
There are two anchors to footnote <a href="#footnote_42">[42]</a>.</p>

<p>Obvious printing errors were corrected, such as
backwards, upside down, partially or unprinted letters and
punctuation, letters in reversed order, and punctuation marks used
as letters. Final stops missing at the end of sentences and
abbreviations were added. Punctuation was standardized (commas
changed to stops and vice versa; open and close quote marks, and spacing
between words). Duplicate words at line endings or page
breaks were removed.</p>

<p>In the section entitled “Pot-Pourri,” the original citations of the
Poe poems were printed across the bottom of the two-column page; these
were moved to follow immediately after the parody of each poem.</p>

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
